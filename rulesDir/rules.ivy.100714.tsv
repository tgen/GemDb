KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients. 	drug class association with cetuximab	Valtorta E, Int J Cancer 2013, 133:1259-1265	colorectal cancer

Overexpression of CIP2A upregulated phospho-Akt and protected Hep3B cells from erlotinib-induced apoptosis. In addition, silencing CIP2A by siRNA restored the effects of erlotinib in Huh-7 cells.  In conclusion, inhibition of CIP2A determines the effects of erlotinib on apoptosis in HCC.

NF1 targeting shRNA constructs decreased sensitivity to erlotinib, with a 26-fold increase in the drug concentration required for an absolute survival inhibition of 50% (IC50) for shNF1#1 and 56-fold for shNF1#2 (Figure 3A) as determined by Cell Titer Blue measurement. Treatment of neurofibromin-deficient lung cancers with a MEK inhibitor restored sensitivity to erlotinib. Low levels of NF1 expression were associated with primary and acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to EGFR TKIs in patients.

This structural variation comprised an identical 2,903-bp genomic deletion that was common to all three resistant samples. The 2.9-kb deleted region contains cis elements that suppress the splicing of BIM exon 3, which, in cells harboring the deletion, results in preferential splicing of exon 3 over exon 4. This polymorphism has a profound effect on the TKI sensitivity of CML and EGFR NSCLC cells, such that one copy of the deleted allele is sufficient to render cells intrinsically TKI resistant. 	class association with erlotinib and gefitinib	Ng K, Nat Med 2012, 18:521-528	NSCLC

Molecular analysis of resistant tumors revealed activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. Consistent with these findings, two separate patients with A+C-resistant tumors exhibited alterations in genes (NF2 and TSC1) that when silenced in EGFR-mutant cells led to activation of the mTOR pathway. In vitro and in vivo, A+C resistance can be overcome by addition of an mTOR pathway inhibitor.  In support of a role for NF2 on TKI sensitivity, knockdown of NF2 led to a decrease in the sensitivity of PC-9 cells to afatinib ( Figure 3C). Importantly, the addition of an mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (RAD001), resensitized PC-9 cells with NF2 knockdown to afatinib in vitro ( Figure 3C).

Molecular analysis of resistant tumors revealed activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. Consistent with these findings, two separate patients with A+C-resistant tumors exhibited alterations in genes (NF2 and TSC1) that when silenced in EGFR-mutant cells led to activation of the mTOR pathway. The somatic status and zygosity of the TSC1 L116fs∗2 alteration were consistent with a somatic alteration clonally present on a single TSC1 copy in the tumor, indicating that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurred. Knockdown of TSC1 in PC-9 cells led to a decrease in sensitivity of the cells to afatinib, and sensitivity to afatinib was restored by the addition of everolimus ( Figure 3F). These results indicate that the absence of TSC1 mediates resistance to EGFR-directed therapies by activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway.

(A) Decitabine GI50 is inversely correlated with DCK expression and growth fraction (higher DCK implies longer intracellular half-life and a higher doubling time implies a smaller S-phase fraction). Decitabine GI50 did not correlate with UCK2 expression (data not shown).

The combination repressed growth and cyclin D1 expression in cyclin-E- and KRAS/p53-driven transgenic lung cancer cells. The window-of-opportunity trial in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (10 evaluable), including cases with KRAS mutations, repressed cyclin D1 (in tumor biopsies and buccal swabs) and induced necrosis and inflammatory responses. The phase II trial in heavily pretreated, advanced NSCLC patients (40 evaluable; a median of two prior relapses per patient (range, 0-5); 21% with prior EGFR-inhibitor therapy) produced three major clinical responses in patients with prolonged progression-free survival (583-, 665-, and 1,460-plus days). n conclusion, bexarotene plus erlotinib was active in KRAS-driven lung cancer cells, was biologically active in early-stage mutant KRAS NSCLC, and was clinically active in advanced, chemotherapy-refractory mutant KRAS tumors in this study and previous trials.

Resistant cells displayed MET gene amplification, leading to increased expression and constitutive phosphorylation of MET, followed by subsequent amplification and overexpression of wild-type (wt) KRAS. Cells harboring KRAS amplification progressively lost their MET dependence and acquired KRAS dependence. FISH analysis showed that the extra copies of KRAS were progressively acquired as double minutes outside chromosome 12 (where KRAS is positioned; Fig. 3D). Our results suggest that MET and KRAS amplification is a general mechanism of resistance to specific MET inhibitors given that similar results were observed with two small inhibitors and in different cell lines of different histotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that overexpression of wt KRAS can overcome the inhibitory effect of a RTK inhibitor. 	drug class association with crizotinib	Cepero V, Cancer Res 2010, 70:7580-7590	gastric cancer

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients. 	unspecified	Valtorta E, Int J Cancer 2013, 133:1259-1265	colorectal cancer

EGFRvIII appears to have intrinsic phosphoactivation independent of dimerization as matuzumab blockade of homodimerization had no effect on receptor phosphorylation levels. These data suggest differences in the dimerization-blocking efficacy of EGFR monoclonal antibodies as mutant EGFR dimer configurations prevalent in GBMs can evade blockade by anti-EGFR treatments. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether this evasion contributes to poor therapeutic response or resistance.	unspecified	Gajadhar A, Mol Cancer Res 2012, 10:428-440	glioblastoma

Importantly, the addition of an mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (RAD001), resensitized PC-9 cells with NF2 knockdown to afatinib in vitro ( Figure 3C).The same effect was observed in HCC827 cells upon cetuximab treatment ( Figure S3B). Taken together, these patient and in vitro data suggest that the NF2 mutations were acquired during treatment on A+C and that NF2 loss leads to activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway to mediate drug resistance. These findings pinpoint enhanced mTORC1 activation as a mechanism of resistance to afatinib plus cetuximab and identify genomic mechanisms that lead to activation of this pathway, revealing a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients with resistance to these drugs.

Here, we show for the first time that MGST1 can protect cells from several cytostatic drugs, chlorambucil, melphalan and cisplatin in an acute toxicity test (MTT assay) as well as a long-term colony forming efficiency cytotoxicity test. It is of note that these cells do not overexpress multidrug transporters, a prerequisite for protection with certain other GSTs investigated in this system.	unspecified	Johansson K, Carcinogenesis 2007, 28:465-470	breast cancer

Treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, alone increased the accumulation of LC3-II and potentiated the effect of CPZ. In contrast, exogenous expression of AKT partially inhibited CPZ-induced LC3-II formation. When U-87MG cells were implanted into the brain of athymic nude mouse, CPZ triggered autophagy and inhibited xenograft tumor growth.

In fact knockdown of ATF4 significantly increased the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in both in vitro and in vivo assays, while overexpression of this molecule dramatically decreased the sensitivity of HCC cell lines to cisplatin. Additionally, we found that synthesis of glutathione was significantly reduced in HCC cell lines subjected to ATF4 knockdown. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ATF4 can increase resistance to cisplatin in HCC by increased biosynthesis of glutathione.	unspecified	Zhang Z, Cancer Biol Ther 2012, 13:435-442	hepatocellular carcinoma

Conversely, dCK overexpression blunted ABCG2-mediated efflux of clofarabine by increasing the formation of clofarabine nucleotides. The use of an ABCG2 inhibitor confirmed that ABCG2 export of clofarabine is maximal when dCK levels are minimal.

The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib.	SNVs are associated with activation and drug sensitivity. However, not all changes may result in activation. In addition, some SNVs may inhibit drug-target interaction and promote drug insensitivity.

Resistant cells displayed MET gene amplification, leading to increased expression and constitutive phosphorylation of MET, followed by subsequent amplification and overexpression of wild-type (wt) KRAS. Cells harboring KRAS amplification progressively lost their MET dependence and acquired KRAS dependence. FISH analysis showed that the extra copies of KRAS were progressively acquired as double minutes outside chromosome 12 (where KRAS is positioned; Fig. 3D). Our results suggest that MET and KRAS amplification is a general mechanism of resistance to specific MET inhibitors given that similar results were observed with two small inhibitors and in different cell lines of different histotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that overexpression of wt KRAS can overcome the inhibitory effect of a RTK inhibitor. 	unspecified	Cepero V, Cancer Res 2010, 70:7580-7590	gastric cancer

Six different ROS1 kinase domain point mutations were identified either alone or in combination, the two most frequent being V2098I and G1971E (Fig. 4A).  The L1947R, L1982F, and V2098I mutations map close to structural features that are implicated in inhibitor binding (nucleotide binding loop, helix alphaC, and activation loop, respectively). Importantly, mutations of L1152 in ALK, a residue homologous to L1982 in ROS1, confer crizotinib resistance and this mutation was recently identified in a patient with crizotinib-treated NSCLC with clinical resistance. Also, DFG motif-proximal mutations in ALK exhibit increased resistance to crizotinib.

A culture established from PV1 was also analyzed.RESULTS: We identified two NRAS-activating somatic mutations, Q61R and Q61K, affecting two main subpopulations in the metastasis PV1 and a BRAF alternative splicing, involving exons 4-10, in the metastasis PV2. These alterations, known to confer resistance to RAF inhibitors, were tumor-specific, mutually exclusive, and were not detected in pretreatment tumor samples.	class association with vemurafenib	Romano E, Clin Cancer Res 2013, Epub	melanoma

MEK2 mutations have not previously been identified in patients with acquired resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, although similar mutations were found to confer resistance to single-agent RAF inhibitors in a companion study. MEK2Q60P is homologous to MEK1Q56P, which confers resistance to monotherapy with RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in post-progression tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.  MEK2Q60P conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK). Compared with parental controls and cells expressing wild-type MEK2, the MEK2Q60P mutation conferred profound resistance to the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib (Fig. 2A), as well as to single-agent dabrafenib (Fig. 2B) and trametinib (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, MEK2Q60P did not confer resistance to treatment with an extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (Fig. 2D), which targets the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK1/2. Cells expressing MEK2Q60P exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 at baseline and when treated with dabrafenib/trametinib than wild-type A375 cells or those expressing wild-type MEK2 (Fig. 2E), indicative of enhanced MAPK pathway activation despite combined therapeutic blockade of this pathway.  	unspecified	Wagle N, Cancer Discov 2014, 4:61-68	melanoma

We overexpressed MITF in two additional BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma cell lines (SKMEL19 and UACC62) and performed cell growth inhibition studies using the RAF inhibitor tool compound (PLX4720). In both cell lines, MITF overexpression conferred a 30- to 80-fold increase in the PLX4720 GI50 values relative to control (LacZ) gene expression ( Fig.  4D and E ). 	unspecified	Van Allen E, Cancer Discov 2014, 4:94-109	melanoma

Overexpression of MAP3K5 or MAP3K9 mutants in HEK293T cells reduced the phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases. Attenuation of MAP3K9 function in melanoma cells using siRNA led to increased cell viability after temozolomide treatment, suggesting that decreased MAP3K pathway activity can lead to chemoresistance in melanoma.

Taken together, the functional genomic data on the samples from these three patients suggest that there are two different classes of CSF3R mutations: truncation mutations, which result in dysregulation of SRC family–TNK2 kinases, and membrane proximal mutations, which result in dysregulation of JAK family kinases. The data also suggest that truncation mutations confer sensitivity to dasatinib but not to JAK kinase inhibitors, whereas the reverse is true for membrane proximal mutant cells.	unspecified	Maxson J, N Engl J Med 2013, 368:1781-1790	Chronic neutrophilic leukemia and atypical (BCR-ABL1-negative) CML

Four of these six sites (Leu-248, Val-299, Thr-315, and Phe-317) are BMS-354825 contact residues, as shown by crystallographic analysis, and account for 97.5% of isolates. The exceptions were four clones of E255K and one clone of Q252H, mutants shown previously to have a BMS-354825 IC50 for growth <10-fold higher than WT BCR-ABL. 	unspecified	Burgess M, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2005, 102:3395-3400	BaF3 screen

Gab2-mediated TKI resistance was associated with persistent phosphorylation of Gab2 Y452, a PI3K recruitment site, and consistent with this finding, the protective effect of Gab2 was completely abolished by the combination of dasatinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.

While no (3H)-dexrazoxane binding was detected (data not shown) with the mutants Y50F, Y165S, and L169F (which were shown to be totally resistant to dexrazoxane inhibition), the level of drug binding with the partially resistant mutants L169I, R162Q, and R162K correlates well with their level of drug resistance in vitro (compare Figure 4A and B). Interestingly, an altered active site tyrosine mutant of human topoisomerase II alpha, which is incapable of carrying out DNA strand passage, was unable to bind dexrazoxane, which agrees with the drug's proposed mechanism of action late in the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle. The direct correlation between the level of drug binding and dexrazoxane resistance is consistent with a decreased drug binding mechanism of action for these dexrazoxane resistance conferring mutations.	unspecified	Renodon-Comiere A, Biochemistry 2003, 42:9749-9754	unspecified

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients. 	drug class association with cetuximab	Valtorta E, Int J Cancer 2013, 133:1259-1265	colorectal cancer

Importantly, proliferation of gefitinib-resistant cells was dependent on the FGF2 -FGFR1 pathway. Mechanistically, inhibition of either FGF2 or FGFR1 by siRNA or FGFR inhibitor (PD173074) restored gefitinib sensitivity in PC9 GR cells. These data suggest that FGF2 -FGFR1 activation through an autocrine loop is a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.	Drug class relation with gefitinib.

As2O3 targets PML for degradation through a SUMOylation-dependent process, potently promoting long-term remission in patients and mice with acute promyelocytic leukemia bearing the PML/RAR fusion. Its role in solid cancers has yet to be established. However, As2O3 given with standard chemotherapy can be tolerated by GBM patients, as demonstrated in recent clinical trials.

This structural variation comprised an identical 2,903-bp genomic deletion that was common to all three resistant samples. The 2.9-kb deleted region contains cis elements that suppress the splicing of BIM exon 3, which, in cells harboring the deletion, results in preferential splicing of exon 3 over exon 4. This polymorphism has a profound effect on the TKI sensitivity of CML and EGFR NSCLC cells, such that one copy of the deleted allele is sufficient to render cells intrinsically TKI resistant. 	unspecified	Ng K, Nat Med 2012, 18:521-528	NSCLC

Consistent with the concept that increased ABC2 expression contributes to the resistant phenotype, we observed that the rate of efflux of dansylated estramustine was increased in SKEM compared with control cells.

Consistent with the concept that increased ABC2 expression contributes to the resistant phenotype, we observed that the rate of efflux of dansylated estramustine was increased in SKEM compared with control cells. In addition, antisense treatment directed toward ABC2 mRNA sensitized the resistant cells to estramustine.

One mutation, mTOR E2419K is a well-described activating mutation in the kinase domain of mTOR, even though it has not been identified in human cancer to date. The second mutation we identified, mTOR E2014K, occurs in the FKBP–rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain of mTOR. As shown in Fig. 2C , overexpression of mTOR E2419K or mTOR E2014K individually resulted in increased phosphorylation of S6K1 as compared with wildtype mTOR ( Fig. 2C , lanes 4 and 7 compared with lane 1).  As shown in Fig. 2C , treatment with 0.1 micromol/L of rapamycin completely abrogated S6K1 phosphorylation by both wild-type and mutant mTOR, suggesting that these mutations remain highly sensitive to allosteric inhibition.	unspecified	Wagle N, Cancer Discov 2014, Epub	Urothelial cancer

Studies with inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from transfected cells showed that MRP5 mediates ATP-dependent transport of 5 micromol/L [(3)H]5-FdUMP, [(3)H]5-FUMP, [(3)H]dUMP, and not [(3)H]5-FUdR, or [(3)H]5-FU.hus, MRP5 transports the monophosphorylated metabolite of this nucleoside and when MRP5 is overexpressed in colorectal and breast tumors, it may contribute to 5-FU drug resistance.	unspecified	Pratt S, Mol Cancer Ther 2005, 4:855-863	colorectal cancer, breast cancer

In general, the low TS expression status of a tumor is thought to predict 5FU responsiveness, whereas high TS expression provides resistance. Using genetic engineering, we deleted the short tandem repeat (two repeats) allele and retained the long (three repeats) allele to produce artificial LOH at the TS gene; the TS(+/-) line had a reduced TS protein expression and was hypersensitive to 5FU and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine in vitro as compared with syngeneic control lines. We linked this sensitivity directly to the reduced TS expression by introducing exogenous TS cDNA expression into the TS(+/-) line (i.e., increased TS copies). Our model predicts that the 5FU sensitivity of a tumor is modified by aneuploidy producing copy number changes of TS alleles by one or more of the following: LOH, amplification, and, as presented here, copy number changes due to polysomy. The data suggest that TS copy number in a patient's tumor may be a dominating variable affecting 5FU responsiveness.	unspecified	Brody J, Cancer Res 2006, 66:9369-9373	colorectal cancer

We found that resistant mutants contained 1-5 amino acid substitutions and that these substitutions were located along the entire length of the polypeptide. Mutations were frequent near the active site Cys(195) and in the catalytically important Arg(50) loop; however, many mutations were also distributed throughout the remainder of the cDNA. Mutants containing a single amino acid replacement identified the following 14 residues as unreported sites of resistance: Glu(23), Thr(51), Thr(53), Val(84), Lys(93), Asp(110), Asp(116), Pro(194), Ser(206), Met(219), His(250), Asp(254), Tyr(258), and Lys(284). Many of these residues are distant from the active site and/or have no documented function in catalysis or resistance. We conclude that mutations distributed throughout the linear sequence and three-dimensional structure of human TS can confer resistance to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine.

RNA interference-mediated silencing of dUTPase significantly sensitized NSCLC cells to growth inhibition induced by FUdR (floxuridine) and pemetrexed.

This active metabolite, along with the reduced folate cofactor, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, forms a stable inhibitory complex with thymidylate synthase that blocks cellular growth. The present study shows that the ATP-dependent multidrug resistance protein-5 (MRP5, ABCC5) confers resistance to 5-FU by transporting the monophosphate metabolites. In 3-day cytotoxicity assays, MRP5-transfected cells were approximately 9-fold resistant to 5-FU and 6-thioguanine. Studies with inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from transfected cells showed that MRP5 mediates ATP-dependent transport of 5 micromol/L [(3)H]5-FdUMP, [(3)H]5-FUMP, [(3)H]dUMP, and not [(3)H]5-FUdR, or [(3)H]5-FU.hus, MRP5 transports the monophosphorylated metabolite of this nucleoside and when MRP5 is overexpressed in colorectal and breast tumors, it may contribute to 5-FU drug resistance.	unspecified	Pratt S, Mol Cancer Ther 2005, 4:855-863	colorectal cancer, breast cancer

In general, the low TS expression status of a tumor is thought to predict 5FU responsiveness, whereas high TS expression provides resistance. Using genetic engineering, we deleted the short tandem repeat (two repeats) allele and retained the long (three repeats) allele to produce artificial LOH at the TS gene; the TS(+/-) line had a reduced TS protein expression and was hypersensitive to 5FU and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine in vitro as compared with syngeneic control lines. We linked this sensitivity directly to the reduced TS expression by introducing exogenous TS cDNA expression into the TS(+/-) line (i.e., increased TS copies). Our model predicts that the 5FU sensitivity of a tumor is modified by aneuploidy producing copy number changes of TS alleles by one or more of the following: LOH, amplification, and, as presented here, copy number changes due to polysomy. The data suggest that TS copy number in a patient's tumor may be a dominating variable affecting 5FU responsiveness.	unspecified	Brody J, Cancer Res 2006, 66:9369-9373	colorectal cancer

Analysis of TYMS by fluorescence in situ hybridization identified TYMS gene amplification in 23% of 31 5-FU-treated cancers, whereas no amplification was observed in metastases of patients that had not been treated with 5-FU. Patients with metastases containing TYMS amplification had a substantially shorter median survival (329 days) than those without amplification (1,021 days, P <0.01). These data suggest that genetic amplification of TYMS is a major mechanism of 5-FU resistance in vivo and have important implications for the management of colorectal cancer patients with recurrent disease. 	unspecified	Wang T, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2004, 101:3098-3094	colorectal cancer

These mutations were not detected in primary or treatment-naive ER(+) cancer or in any stage of ER(-) disease. Together, five ESR1 mutants were identified in this study (encoding p.Leu536Gln, p.Tyr537Ser, p.Asp538Gly, p.Tyr537Cys and p.Tyr573Asn alterations). Functional studies in cell line models demonstrate that these mutations render estrogen receptor constitutive activity and confer partial resistance to currently available endocrine treatments.  As expected, wild-type ESR1 was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen, fulvestrant and endoxifen (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 4–6).  Interestingly, ESR1 with each of the five LBD alterations identified in this study was inhibited by tamoxifen and fulvestrant in a dose-dependent fashion. The IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values for both 4-hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant were two- to fourfold higher for all mutants compared to wild-type ESR1. Fulvestrant exhibited greater maximal inhibition than 4-hydroxytamoxifen for all the mutants tested (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5).  It has been suggested that more potent ER antagonists, such as the next generation of estrogen receptor degraders, may have therapeutic benefit.	unspecified	Robinson D, Nat Genet 2013, 45:1446-1451	breast cancer

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients. 	drug class association with cetuximab	Valtorta E, Int J Cancer 2013, 133:1259-1265	colorectal cancer

NF1 targeting shRNA constructs decreased sensitivity to erlotinib, with a 26-fold increase in the drug concentration required for an absolute survival inhibition of 50% (IC50) for shNF1#1 and 56-fold for shNF1#2 (Figure 3A) as determined by Cell Titer Blue measurement. Treatment of neurofibromin-deficient lung cancers with a MEK inhibitor restored sensitivity to erlotinib. Low levels of NF1 expression were associated with primary and acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to EGFR TKIs in patients. Using RNA sequencing data from a separate set of three human lung adenocarcinomas treated with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib), we identified reduced NF1expression in all three post-treatment tumours, with the strongest reduction in the two EGFR-TKI resistant samples that did not express T790M (V1 and V3) and failed to respond to a second-line treatment with afatinib (Figure 7B).

This structural variation comprised an identical 2,903-bp genomic deletion that was common to all three resistant samples. The 2.9-kb deleted region contains cis elements that suppress the splicing of BIM exon 3, which, in cells harboring the deletion, results in preferential splicing of exon 3 over exon 4.

Here, we grew breakpoint cluster region/Abelson murine leukemia (Bcr/Abl) P190 lymphoblasts on stroma and made them resistant to the FTI SCH66336/lonafarnib to model emerging drug resistance in a patient. These cells exhibited greatly increased (> 100-fold) expression levels of a novel ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-homologous gene, ATP11A. We showed that overexpression of this gene provided protection against the effects of SCH66336, whereas knockdown of endogenous ATP11a using small interfering RNA (siRNA) made cells more sensitive to this drug. The lymphoblasts that were resistant to this FTI were also more resistant to FTI-276 and to GGTI-298, 2 other structurally similar inhibitors.

We dissected the underlying molecular mechanism using various Gab2 mutants and kinase inhibitors and identified the Shp2/Ras/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axes as the two critical signaling pathways. Gab2-mediated TKI resistance was associated with persistent phosphorylation of Gab2 Y452, a PI3K recruitment site, and consistent with this finding, the protective effect of Gab2 was completely abolished by the combination of dasatinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. The identification of Gab2 as a novel modulator of TKI sensitivity in CML suggests that Gab2 could be exploited as a biomarker and therapeutic target in TKI-resistant disease.	unspecified	Wohrle F, Leukemia 2013, 27:118-1129	CML

Inhibition of PXR expression by lentivirus-mediated shRNA, led to SN38 chemoresistance reversion concomitantly to a decrease of UGT1A1 expression and SN38 glucuronidation.	unspecified	Raynal C, Mol Cancer 2010, 9:46	colorectal cancer

Systemically administered itraconazole, like other Hh pathway antagonists, can suppress Hh pathway activity and the growth of medulloblastoma in a mouse allograft model and does so at serum levels comparable to those in patients undergoing antifungal therapy.  We investigated the target of itraconazole action within the Hh pathway by examining cells with the Ptch gene disrupted by in frame fusion of lacZ. Loss of PTCH function in these cells causes constitutive pathway activity and consequent expression of  beta-galactosidase through activation of the Ptch promoter. Itraconazole treatment of these cells inhibited  beta-galactosidase expression at levels similar to those required for inhibition of pathway activity in SHHN-stimulated Shh-Light2 cells (IC50 approximately 900 nM; Figure 4A). These results indicate that itraconazole acts independently of and downstream of PTCH. Having characterized the Hh pathway inhibitory activity of itraconazole in vitro, we examined its effect in vivo by systemic treatment of animals subcutaneously engrafted with a primary medulloblastoma from a Ptch+/−; p53−/− mouse. Medulloblastomas from these mice depend on constitutive Hh pathway activity for their growth ( Berman et al., 2002, Goodrich et al., 1997 and Romer et al., 2004) and this growth can be inhibited by pathway antagonists ( Berman et al., 2002 and Romer et al., 2004). Treatment with itraconazole indeed inhibited growth of these subcutaneous allografts, with similar inhibition of tumor growth noted for animals treated with itraconazole at 100 mg/kg twice per day (b.i.d.) or 75 mg/kg b.i.d. ( Figure 6A). To further assess the activity of itraconazole on suppression of Hh-dependent tumors, we used K14-CreER; Ptch+/−; p53 fl/fl mice to generate endogenous basal cell carcinomas (BCC) of the skin (see Experimental Procedures). BCC tumors generated from these mice have increased levels of Hh pathway activity and their growth is suppressed by Hh pathway inhibitors ( Xiao et al., 2009). Itraconazole treatment suppressed the growth of the endogenous BCC tumors when compared with the cyclodextrin vehicle control ( Figure 7A).	unspecified	Kim J, Cancer Cell 2010, 17:388-399	medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients. 	drug class association with cetuximab	Valtorta E, Int J Cancer 2013, 133:1259-1265	colorectal cancer

Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. Lapatinib treatment decreased the number of colonies formed in all mutations, except for L755S. 	SNVs should be activating and associated with drug response.

This structural variation comprised an identical 2,903-bp genomic deletion that was common to all three resistant samples. The 2.9-kb deleted region contains cis elements that suppress the splicing of BIM exon 3, which, in cells harboring the deletion, results in preferential splicing of exon 3 over exon 4. This polymorphism has a profound effect on the TKI sensitivity of CML and EGFR NSCLC cells, such that one copy of the deleted allele is sufficient to render cells intrinsically TKI resistant. 	class association with erlotinib and gefitinib	Ng K, Nat Med 2012, 18:521-528	NSCLC

Binding constants were also determined for selected kinases (Table 1). MBZ showed strong activity with Kds in the nanomolar range against ABL kinases including the T315I and E255K mutations. MBZ was also shown to potently bind to BRAF and especially to mutant BRAF (V600E). Analysis of the activity of MBD using NCI60 z score data revealed cancer subpanel sensitivities of 100 percent (leukemia), 80 percent (colon cancer), and 67 percent (CNS).

Using this method we discovered that mebendazole, an anti-parasitic with anti-cancer properties, has the structural potential to inhibit VEGFR2 (KDR). We confirmed experimentally that in vitro mebendazole binds to VEGFR2 and inhibits kinase activity at 3.6 micromolar (Figure 8a).

One of these hits is nitazoxanide, a thiazolide for treating human protozoal infections. Validation of nitazoxanide in different cancer cell lines revealed a high potency for c-Myc inhibition with IC50 ranging between 10 and 500 nmol/L. Oral administration of nitazoxanide in breast cancer xenograft mouse models significantly suppressed tumor growth by inhibition of c-Myc and induction of apoptosis.

The functional effects of the Arg240Trp mutation were investigated in CHOK1 cells stably expressing WT or mutant sst5. Incubation with the somatostatin analog octreotide (1 nm for 24 h) caused a significant reduction of FCS-induced proliferation of WT cells (25 +/- 2% inhibition, P< 0.001). Conversely, in mutant cells octreotide did not cause any reduction of growth rate (Fig. 3B). Therefore, although the phenotype resulting from the expression of mutant sst5 has been characterized in cells without secretory properties, such as CHOK1, we suggest that the mutation of sst5 gene together with the low expression of sst2, may be responsible for the resistance to octreotide observed in this patient. The presence of a germ-line mutation is consistent with the phenotype of the patient because the expression of this receptor is restricted to specific cell types.

SSTR5 mRNA was detected in two tumors from the responder, but not in one tumor that was resistant to OCT. These observations suggest that the temporal decrease of TSH by OCT may be mediated by SSTR2, and that the long term response to OCT therapy may be related with the expression of SSTR5.

Serum TSH levels were decreased by OCT administration test in all patients but OCT therapy was effective in two patients out of three. SSTR5 mRNA was detected in two tumors from the responder, but not in one tumor that was resistant to OCT. These observations suggest that the temporal decrease of TSH by OCT may be mediated by SSTR2, and that the long term response to OCT therapy may be related with the expression of SSTR5. Therefore, the expression of SSTR5 in TSHoma may be a useful marker for predicting the outcome of the therapy, but further studies with larger numbers of patients are necessary.	unspecified	Yoshihara A, Endocr J 2007, 54:133-138	Pituitary adenoma

EGFRvIII appears to have intrinsic phosphoactivation independent of dimerization as matuzumab blockade of homodimerization had no effect on receptor phosphorylation levels. These data suggest differences in the dimerization-blocking efficacy of EGFR monoclonal antibodies as mutant EGFR dimer configurations prevalent in GBMs can evade blockade by anti-EGFR treatments. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether this evasion contributes to poor therapeutic response or resistance.	unspecified	Gajadhar A, Mol Cancer Res 2012, 10:428-440	glioblastoma

Previously we reported the analysis of metastases from patients who developed resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab and showed the emergence of KRAS amplification in one sample and acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in 60% (6 out of 10) of the cases.	unspecified	Valtorta E, Int J Cancer 2013, 133:1259-1265	colorectal cancer

Surprisingly, KRAS gene expression is downregulated in KRAS wild-type and KRAS-mutant cells by antifolates, which may also contribute to higher efficacy of antifolates in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells.	SNVs should be activating and associated with drug response. However, all SNVs may not result in activation. 	Moran D, Mol Cancer Ther 2014, 13:1611-1624	NSCLC

FGFR2 has been found to be amplified and overexpressed in the colon cancer cell line H716 (13). We found that ponatinib potently inhibited the growth of H716 cells with a GI50 value of 7 nmol/L but did not affect the growth of Colo205 cells (430 nmol/L; Fig. 5D) that lack constitutive FGFR2 phosphorylation (data not shown). We next evaluated the activity of ponatinib in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines, SUM 52PE and MFM-223, that overexpress FGFR2 due to genomic amplification (8). Ponatinib inhibited growth of SUM 52PE and MFM-223 cells with GI50 values of 14 and 69 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 5B). In contrast, ponatinib had minimal effect on growth of the wild-type FGFR, ER-negative cell line MDA-MB-231 (GI50 = 518 nmol/L; Fig. 5B; ref. 8). Target inhibition was confirmed by the dose-dependent loss of FGFR2 phosphorylation in SUM 52PE cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B) and MFM-223 cells (data not shown) with IC50 values of 6 and 7 nmol/L, respectively.

FGFR2 has been found to be amplified and overexpressed in the colon cancer cell line H716 (13). We found that ponatinib potently inhibited the growth of H716 cells with a GI50 value of 7 nmol/L but did not affect the growth of Colo205 cells (430 nmol/L; Fig. 5D) that lack constitutive FGFR2 phosphorylation (data not shown). We next evaluated the activity of ponatinib in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines, SUM 52PE and MFM-223, that overexpress FGFR2 due to genomic amplification (8). Ponatinib inhibited growth of SUM 52PE and MFM-223 cells with GI50 values of 14 and 69 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 5B). In contrast, ponatinib had minimal effect on growth of the wild-type FGFR, ER-negative cell line MDA-MB-231 (GI50 = 518 nmol/L; Fig. 5B; ref. 8). Target inhibition was confirmed by the dose-dependent loss of FGFR2 phosphorylation in SUM 52PE cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B) and MFM-223 cells (data not shown) with IC50 values of 6 and 7 nmol/L, respectively.

We evaluated the effects of ponatinib in endometrial cancer cell lines that express FGFR2 with either an activating mutation in the kinase domain (N549K; AN3CA and MFE-296 cells) or a mutation that increases ligand binding (S252W; MFE-280 cells; refs. 16, 17). Ponatinib inhibited growth of AN3CA and MFE-296 cells with GI50 values of 14 and 61 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A). The S252W mutation, in the extracellular region of FGFR2, does not lead to constitutive FGFR2 phosphorylation but does increase ligand-binding affinity (28); therefore, we evaluated the effects of ponatinib on MFE-280 cells grown in the presence of FGF2. Under these conditions, ponatinib inhibited growth with a GI50 value of 35 nmol/L (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ponatinib did not potently inhibit growth of endometrial cancer cells (RL95-2) that do not contain mutated FGFR2 (GI50 > 300 nmol/L; Fig. 2A; ref. 17). To examine the effect of ponatinib on growth of FGFR2N549K mutant cells in vivo, ponatinib or vehicle was administered orally once daily for 11 days to mice bearing AN3CA xenografts. As shown in Fig. 2C, tumor growth was not substantially inhibited in mice dosed with 3 mg/kg ponatinib. In contrast, growth was inhibited by 49% in mice dosed with 10 mg/kg and by 82% (P < 0.05) in mice dosed with 30 mg/kg. To confirm target modulation in vivo, mice bearing AN3CA xenografts were treated with a single oral dose of ponatinib or vehicle and tumors harvested 6 hours later. Consistent with the effects of ponatinib on tumor growth, dose-dependent effects on target phosphorylation were observed and were associated with increasing plasma levels of ponatinib. While partial inhibition of FGFR2 and FRS2alpha phosphorylation was observed after a 3 mg/kg dose, more than 80% inhibition was observed after doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg (Fig. 2D). 	SNVs should be activating and result in drug sensitivity. However, not all changes may result in activation. Some changes may be inactivating and/or others associated with drug resistance.

As expected, wild-type ESR1 was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen, fulvestrant and endoxifen (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 4–6).

Using a catalytically inactive, dominant negative protein form of human APE1 (APEX1), termed ED, which binds with high affinity to substrate DNA and blocks subsequent repair steps, we assessed the role of BER in mediating cellular resistance to clinically relevant alkylating drugs and antimetabolites. Colony formation assays revealed that ED expression enhanced cellular sensitivity to melphalan not at all; to decarbazine, thiotepa, busulfan and carmustine moderately (1.2- to 2.4-fold); and to streptozotocin and temozolomide significantly (2.0- to 5.3-fold). Most impressively, ED expression produced an approximately 5- and 25-fold augmentation of the cell killing effect of 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, respectively, implicating BER in the cellular response to such antimetabolites; the increased 5-fluorouracil sensitivity was associated with an accumulation of abasic sites and active caspase-positive staining.

Using a catalytically inactive, dominant negative protein form of human APE1 (APEX1), termed ED, which binds with high affinity to substrate DNA and blocks subsequent repair steps, we assessed the role of BER in mediating cellular resistance to clinically relevant alkylating drugs and antimetabolites. Colony formation assays revealed that ED expression enhanced cellular sensitivity to melphalan not at all; to decarbazine, thiotepa, busulfan and carmustine moderately (1.2- to 2.4-fold); and to streptozotocin and temozolomide significantly (2.0- to 5.3-fold). Most impressively, ED expression produced an approximately 5- and 25-fold augmentation of the cell killing effect of 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, respectively, implicating BER in the cellular response to such antimetabolites; the increased 5-fluorouracil sensitivity was associated with an accumulation of abasic sites and active caspase-positive staining.

The results presented here suggest a clinically actionable strategy to combine resistance by combining As2O3 with mTOR kinase and EGFR TKIs for the treatment of GBM patients. 	class association with sirolimus	Galvin J, Cancer Biol Ther 2013, 14:411-416	glioblastoma

Consequently, the compounds inhibit anti-apoptotic NFkappaB signaling and elicit toxic effects selectively on MALT1-dependent ABC-DLBCL cells in vitro and in vivo.

Moreover, using an isogenic in vitro system deficient in APTX, we show that aprataxin directly regulates the cellular sensitivity to camptothecin, suggesting that it could be used to predict patient response to irinotecan.  High levels of expression of aprataxin are associated with poor response to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. 	class association with irinotecan	Dopeso H, Clin Cancer Res 2010, 16:2375-2382	colorectal cancer

Camptothecin-resistant cancer cell lines and normal cell lines display lower CK2 activity, lower topo I phosphorylation, lower topo I activity, and undetectable topo I/p14ARF complex formation. Experimental inhibition or activation of CK2 demonstrates that CK2 is necessary and sufficient for regulating these topo I properties and altering cellular responses to camptothecin.

As a single agent, PD0325901 suppressed the growth of NF1-deficient, MEK inhibitor-sensitive cells in vivo as well. Mechanistically, NF1-deficient, MEK inhibitor-sensitive cells were dependent upon the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway for growth and did not activate the PI3K pathway as a mechanism of acquired resistance. Importantly, NF1-deficient cells intrinsically resistant to MEK inhibition were sensitized by the addition of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103.

In these studies, cell lines with BRAF mutations were very sensitive to MEK inhibition of cell growth while cell lines with NRAS mutations showed a range of sensitivities, in agreement with the present results.	unspecified	Stones C, Front Genet 2013, 4:66	melanoma

None of the lines were sensitive (with lower than 1 micromol/L IC50s) to the EGFR-TKI, erlotinib, the ALK/MET/RON/ROS1 inhibitor, crizotinib, or the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitor, linsitinib.

In three of these patients, we identified additional mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations in the resistant tumor that were not detected in the pretreatment tumor, including a novel activating mutation in MEK2 (MEK2Q60P). RNA-seq data demonstrated that this mutation, MEK2Q60P, was expressed in the resistant tumor but not in the pretreatment tumor (Fig. 1A, right). MEK2 mutations have not previously been identified in patients with acquired resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, although similar mutations were found to confer resistance to single-agent RAF inhibitors in a companion study. MEK2Q60P is homologous to MEK1Q56P, which confers resistance to monotherapy with RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in post-progression tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.  MEK2Q60P conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK). Compared with parental controls and cells expressing wild-type MEK2, the MEK2Q60P mutation conferred profound resistance to the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib (Fig. 2A), as well as to single-agent dabrafenib (Fig. 2B) and trametinib (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, MEK2Q60P did not confer resistance to treatment with an extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (Fig. 2D), which targets the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK1/2. Cells expressing MEK2Q60P exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 at baseline and when treated with dabrafenib/trametinib than wild-type A375 cells or those expressing wild-type MEK2 (Fig. 2E), indicative of enhanced MAPK pathway activation despite combined therapeutic blockade of this pathway.

Compared with the effects of wild-type MEK2, cells expressing resistance-associated MEK2 mutations were less sensitive to both RAF (dabrafenib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibition. MEK2 C125S conferred profound resistance to both RAF and MEK inhibition, with fold changes in GI50 greater than 100. The MEK2 V35M, L46F, and N126D mutants also engendered resistance to RAF and MEK inhibition, although their effect was not as pronounced as those of MEK2 C125S. All MEK2-mutant alleles examined conferred sustained MEK and ERK phosphorylation in the context of RAF inhbitor treatment (Fig 2F). 	SNVs at this position should be activating and associated with reduced drug response. However, not all SNVs may result in activation.	Van Allen E, Cancer Discov 2014, 4:94-109	melanoma

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients. 	drug class association with cetuximab	Valtorta E, Int J Cancer 2013, 133:1259-1265	colorectal cancer

The Akt inhibitor MK2206 sensitize BRAF-mutant cells to both PLX4720 and AZD6244 and sensitize Galpha-mutant cells to AZD6244 but did not overcome the resistance of the Galpha-mutant cells to PLX4720.	class association with vemurafenib	Mitsiades N, Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2011, 52:7248-7255	uveal melanoma

MEK2 mutations have not previously been identified in patients with acquired resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, although similar mutations were found to confer resistance to single-agent RAF inhibitors in a companion study. MEK2Q60P is homologous to MEK1Q56P, which confers resistance to monotherapy with RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in post-progression tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.  MEK2Q60P conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK). Compared with parental controls and cells expressing wild-type MEK2, the MEK2Q60P mutation conferred profound resistance to the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib (Fig. 2A), as well as to single-agent dabrafenib (Fig. 2B) and trametinib (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, MEK2Q60P did not confer resistance to treatment with an extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (Fig. 2D), which targets the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK1/2. Cells expressing MEK2Q60P exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 at baseline and when treated with dabrafenib/trametinib than wild-type A375 cells or those expressing wild-type MEK2 (Fig. 2E), indicative of enhanced MAPK pathway activation despite combined therapeutic blockade of this pathway.  	class association with dabrafenib.

MEK2Q60P is homologous to MEK1Q56P, which confers resistance to monotherapy with RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in post-progression tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.  MEK2Q60P conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK). Compared with parental controls and cells expressing wild-type MEK2, the MEK2Q60P mutation conferred profound resistance to the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib (Fig. 2A), as well as to single-agent dabrafenib (Fig. 2B) and trametinib (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, MEK2Q60P did not confer resistance to treatment with an extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (Fig. 2D), which targets the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK1/2. Cells expressing MEK2Q60P exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 at baseline and when treated with dabrafenib/trametinib than wild-type A375 cells or those expressing wild-type MEK2 (Fig. 2E), indicative of enhanced MAPK pathway activation despite combined therapeutic blockade of this pathway.  	class association with dabrafenib	Wagle N, Cancer Discov 2014, 4:61-68	melanoma

MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF- betaR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance.
