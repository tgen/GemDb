KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g).

Treatment of neurofibromin-deficient lung cancers with a MEK inhibitor restored sensitivity to erlotinib.

NF1 targeting shRNA constructs decreased sensitivity to erlotinib, with a 26-fold increase in the drug concentration required for an absolute survival inhibition of 50% (IC50) for shNF1#1 and 56-fold for shNF1#2 (Figure 3A) as determined by Cell Titer Blue measurement. Treatment of neurofibromin-deficient lung cancers with a MEK inhibitor restored sensitivity to erlotinib. Low levels of NF1 expression were associated with primary and acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to EGFR TKIs in patients. Using RNA sequencing data from a separate set of three human lung adenocarcinomas treated with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib), we identified reduced NF1expression in all three post-treatment tumours, with the strongest reduction in the two EGFR-TKI resistant samples that did not express T790M (V1 and V3) and failed to respond to a second-line treatment with afatinib (Figure 7B).

MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF- betaR2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF- betaR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF- beta signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers."	class association with erlotinib and gefitinib	"Huang S, Cell 2012, 151:937-950"	unspecified

NF1 targeting shRNA constructs decreased sensitivity to erlotinib, with a 26-fold increase in the drug concentration required for an absolute survival inhibition of 50% (IC50) for shNF1#1 and 56-fold for shNF1#2 (Figure 3A) as determined by Cell Titer Blue measurement. Treatment of neurofibromin-deficient lung cancers with a MEK inhibitor restored sensitivity to erlotinib. Low levels of NF1 expression were associated with primary and acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to EGFR TKIs in patients. Using RNA sequencing data from a separate set of three human lung adenocarcinomas treated with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib), we identified reduced NF1 expression in all three post-treatment tumours, with the strongest reduction in the two EGFR-TKI resistant samples that did not express T790M (V1 and V3) and failed to respond to a second-line treatment with afatinib (Figure 7B). Experiments with the PC9 cell line confirmed that NF1 silencing strongly reduced sensitivity to afatinib as well (Figure S7A)."	"drug class association with Erlotinib.

Previously untreated patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled in LUX-Lung 3 (n=345) and LUX-Lung 6 (n=364). These patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive afatinib or chemotherapy (pemetrexed-cisplatin [LUX-Lung 3] or gemcitabine-cisplatin [LUX-Lung 6]), stratified by EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion [del19], Leu858Arg, or other) and ethnic origin (LUX-Lung 3 only).  Overall survival was significantly longer for patients with del19-positive tumours in the afatinib group than in the chemotherapy group in both trials: in LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 33.3 months (95 percent CI 26.8-41.5) in the afatinib group versus 21.1 months (16.3-30.7) in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.54, 95 percent CI 0.36-0.79, p=0.0015); in LUX-Lung 6, it was 31.4 months (95 percent CI 24.2-35.3) versus 18.4 months (14.6-25.6), respectively (HR 0.64, 95 percent CI 0.44-0.94, p=0.023).

However, our patient developed skin and nodal relapse 180 days after starting treatment. We now demonstrate that his peripheral blood malignant T cells became resistant to bexarotene-induced apoptosis.Sequence analysis did not reveal acquisition of mutations in the genes encoding RXR-alpha and RXR-beta by resistant cells. We assessed RXR-alpha and RXR-beta expression by Western blot analysis and found that resistant cells had significantly decreased RXR-alpha expression compared with pretherapy bexarotene-sensitive cells. Our findings indicate that reduced expression of the RXR-alpha receptor subunit may represent a mechanism for resistance to bexarotene in T-cell malignancies."	unspecified	"Lin J, Blood 2008, 112:2484-2488"	cutaneous T cell lymphoma

Similar results were obtained when H358 cells with or without LKB1 expression were examined for the effects of Dasatinib and PF573228 on cell migration (Figure 5C). These observations support the notion that the activation of SRC and FAK due to LKB1 loss promotes dependence upon these signaling pathways for cell migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix components as well as migration.	unspecified	"Carretero J, Cancer Cell 2010, 17:547-559"	lung cancer

The extended use of brentuximab-vedotin was reported for CD30-positive nonanaplastic peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) with promising efficacy. CD30 status assessment is thus a critical factor for therapeutic decision. This prompted us to investigate the correlation between semiquantitative CD30 protein assessment by IHC and messenger RNA (mRNA) assessment by microarrays in a cohort of 376 noncutaneous PTCLs representative of the main entities. By IHC, CD30 expression was heterogeneous across and within entities and significantly associated with large tumor cell size.

Resistant cells displayed MET gene amplification, leading to increased expression and constitutive phosphorylation of MET, followed by subsequent amplification and overexpression of wild-type (wt) KRAS. Cells harboring KRAS amplification progressively lost their MET dependence and acquired KRAS dependence. FISH analysis showed that the extra copies of KRAS were progressively acquired as double minutes outside chromosome 12 (where KRAS is positioned; Fig. 3D). Our results suggest that MET and KRAS amplification is a general mechanism of resistance to specific MET inhibitors given that similar results were observed with two small inhibitors and in different cell lines of different histotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that overexpression of wt KRAS can overcome the inhibitory effect of a RTK inhibitor.

We identified a T to C missense mutation at codon 3512, leading to an I1171T amino acid substitution (Fig. 2A). In addition, a cell line was established directly from the biopsy specimen that we designated MGH056-1. As shown in Fig. 5A, ceritinib, but not crizotinib or alectinib, markedly suppressed the cell growth of MGH056-1 cells. Ceritinib also suppressed ALK phosphorylation and downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation to a greater extent than crizotinib and alectinib (Figs. 5B and 2C). Consistent with these results, treatment of patient MGH056 with ceritinib led to significant tumor regression (Fig. 5C), with a confirmed partial response lasting over 7 months.

Additionally one of these reports demonstrated one ALK-positive NSCLC patient harboring an I1171T acquired mutation has responded to ceritinib, another second-generation ALK inhibitor. We reported the presence of an ALK I1171N resistance mutation from comprehensive genomic profiling from a liver biopsy of a progressing metastatic lesion in an ALK+ patient on alectinib after an initial partial response.

We identified a T to C missense mutation at codon 3512, leading to an I1171T amino acid substitution (Fig. 2A). In addition, a cell line was established directly from the biopsy specimen that we designated MGH056-1. As shown in Fig. 5A, ceritinib, but not crizotinib or alectinib, markedly suppressed the cell growth of MGH056-1 cells. Ceritinib also suppressed ALK phosphorylation and downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation to a greater extent than crizotinib and alectinib (Figs. 5B and 2C). Consistent with these results, treatment of patient MGH056 with ceritinib led to significant tumor regression (Fig. 5C), with a confirmed partial response lasting over 7 months. These preclinical and clinical results suggest that ceritinib may be effective in treating cancers that have become resistant to alectinib due to a secondary mutation such as I1171T."	unspecified	"Katayama R, Clin Cancer Res 2014, 20:5686-5696"	non-small cell lung cancer

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients.

Importantly, mutations of L1152 in ALK, a residue homologous to L1982 in ROS1, confer crizotinib resistance and this mutation was recently identified in a patient with crizotinib-treated NSCLC with clinical resistance. Also, DFG motif-proximal mutations in ALK exhibit increased resistance to crizotinib.

In the ALCL group, nine of nine patients obtained CR. Within 2 months of treatment, four patients relapsed, three of whom died shortly after, whereas one (patient 6) obtained a durable response to brentuximab. The 2-year PFS and OS rates are 63.7 perecent and 72.7 percent. In two patients (patients 2 and 6), the kinase domain of NPM/ALK could be amplified from peripheral blood samples obtained at the time of relapse. Deep sequencing of these products revealed the presence of ALK mutations (Q1064R in pt 2 and I1171N plus M1328I in pt 6).

This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond toÊlorlatinibÊ(PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance toÊlorlatinibÊthrough steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib. The patient received crizotinib again, and her cancer-related symptoms and liver failure resolved.Ê"	unspecified	"Shaw A, N Engl J Med 2016, 374:54-61"	NSCLC

EGFR, KRAS and PIK3CA genes were wild type, ALK and ROS1 were negative for rearrangement, but c-MET was amplified by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The kinase inhibitor crizotinib is already in clinical use for the treatment of ALK positive non-small cell lung cancers, but it is also known to be a potent c-MET inhibitor. The patient was treated with the standard dose of twice a day 250 mg crizotinib as a monotherapy. Major partial response to therapy was confirmed by chest CT and PET/CT after 8 weeks on therapy. C-MET expression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to EGFR inhibitors. This case may indicate that c-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be an effective targeted treatment option for squamous cell carcinoma patients, and future clinical trials should be expanded for this patient group as well."	unspecified	"Schwab R, Lung Cancer 2014, 83:109-111"	squamous cell lung carcinoma

Resistant cells displayed MET gene amplification, leading to increased expression and constitutive phosphorylation of MET, followed by subsequent amplification and overexpression of wild-type (wt) KRAS. Cells harboring KRAS amplification progressively lost their MET dependence and acquired KRAS dependence. FISH analysis showed that the extra copies of KRAS were progressively acquired as double minutes outside chromosome 12 (where KRAS is positioned; Fig. 3D). Our results suggest that MET and KRAS amplification is a general mechanism of resistance to specific MET inhibitors given that similar results were observed with two small inhibitors and in different cell lines of different histotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that overexpression of wt KRAS can overcome the inhibitory effect of a RTK inhibitor.

The findings suggest that a targeted inhibitor of ALK has antitumour activity in childhood malignancies harbouring ALK translocations, particularly anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours.

Six different ROS1 kinase domain point mutations were identified either alone or in combination, the two most frequent being V2098I and G1971E (Fig. 4A).  The L1947R, L1982F, and V2098I mutations map close to structural features that are implicated in inhibitor binding (nucleotide binding loop, helix alphaC, and activation loop, respectively). Importantly, mutations of L1152 in ALK, a residue homologous to L1982 in ROS1, confer crizotinib resistance and this mutation was recently identified in a patient with crizotinib-treated NSCLC with clinical resistance. Also, DFG motif-proximal mutations in ALK exhibit increased resistance to crizotinib. The mutations G1971E and C2060G map to locations that are distant to the inhibitor binding site in the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, respectively.  We generated each of the six most frequently recovered crizotinib-resistant mutants (V2098I, G1971E, L1982F, C2060G, L1947R, and E1935G) in Ba/F3 FIGÐROS cells and confirmed their ability to confer IL-3 independence similar to wild-type FIGÐROS (Fig. S5E). As expected, all tested FIGÐROS mutants exhibited increased resistance to crizotinib (IC50 range: 350Ð2,450 nM; Fig. 4B and Fig. S6 A and C). IC50 values of the FIGÐROS mutants for crizotinib were close to or exceeded the clinically achievable maximum plasma concentration (411 ng/mL; 913 nM), suggesting that some of these mutants may be inefficiently inhibited at physiologically relevant concentrations.

Importantly, mutations of L1152 in ALK, a residue homologous to L1982 in ROS1, confer crizotinib resistance and this mutation was recently identified in a patient with crizotinib-treated NSCLC with clinical resistance. Also, DFG motif-proximal mutations in ALK exhibit increased resistance to crizotinib. The mutations G1971E and C2060G map to locations that are distant to the inhibitor binding site in the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, respectively.  We generated each of the six most frequently recovered crizotinib-resistant mutants (V2098I, G1971E, L1982F, C2060G, L1947R, and E1935G) in Ba/F3 FIGÐROS cells and confirmed their ability to confer IL-3 independence similar to wild-type FIGÐROS (Fig. S5E). As expected, all tested FIGÐROS mutants exhibited increased resistance to crizotinib (IC50 range: 350Ð2,450 nM; Fig. 4B and Fig. S6 A and C). IC50 values of the FIGÐROS mutants for crizotinib were close to or exceeded the clinically achievable maximum plasma concentration (411 ng/mL; 913 nM), suggesting that some of these mutants may be inefficiently inhibited at physiologically relevant concentrations.

Six different ROS1 kinase domain point mutations were identified either alone or in combination, the two most frequent being V2098I and G1971E (Fig. 4A).  The L1947R, L1982F, and V2098I mutations map close to structural features that are implicated in inhibitor binding (nucleotide binding loop, helix alphaC, and activation loop, respectively). Importantly, mutations of L1152 in ALK, a residue homologous to L1982 in ROS1, confer crizotinib resistance and this mutation was recently identified in a patient with crizotinib-treated NSCLC with clinical resistance. Also, DFG motif-proximal mutations in ALK exhibit increased resistance to crizotinib.

Resistance mechanisms were identified in 58% progressing tumors. Five MEK1 (K57E, I111S, P124S, G176S, E203K) and one MEK2 (F57C) mutations were identified in seven Prog tumors (Figure S2, S4). The I111S, P124S and G176S MEK1mutants and the F57C MEK2 mutant occurred in the pre-treatment tumors; I111S and P124S have been shown not to preclude clinical response. Functional analyses confirmed that MEK1 K57E and MEK2 F57C mutants restored ERK activation in the presence of dabrafenib, whereas MEK1G176S did not alter melanoma cell sensitivity to dabrafenib (Figure 2).  Based on these results, and previous reports (34, 35), we assigned MEK1 K57E, MEK1 E203K and MEK2 F57C as drivers of resistance (3 of 38, 8%)  (Figure 1A).

In three of these patients, we identified additional mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations in the resistant tumor that were not detected in the pretreatment tumor, including a novel activating mutation in MEK2 (MEK2Q60P). RNA-seq data demonstrated that this mutation, MEK2Q60P, was expressed in the resistant tumor but not in the pretreatment tumor (Fig. 1A, right). MEK2 mutations have not previously been identified in patients with acquired resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, although similar mutations were found to confer resistance to single-agent RAF inhibitors in a companion study. MEK2Q60P is homologous to MEK1Q56P, which confers resistance to monotherapy with RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in post-progression tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.  MEK2Q60P conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signalÐregulated kinase (ERK). Compared with parental controls and cells expressing wild-type MEK2, the MEK2Q60P mutation conferred profound resistance to the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib (Fig. 2A), as well as to single-agent dabrafenib (Fig. 2B) and trametinib (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, MEK2Q60P did not confer resistance to treatment with an extracellular signalÐregulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (Fig. 2D), which targets the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK1/2. Cells expressing MEK2Q60P exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 at baseline and when treated with dabrafenib/trametinib than wild-type A375 cells or those expressing wild-type MEK2 (Fig. 2E), indicative of enhanced MAPK pathway activation despite combined therapeutic blockade of this pathway.

In three of these patients, we identified additional mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations in the resistant tumor that were not detected in the pretreatment tumor, including a novel activating mutation in MEK2 (MEK2Q60P). RNA-seq data demonstrated that this mutation, MEK2Q60P, was expressed in the resistant tumor but not in the pretreatment tumor (Fig. 1A, right). MEK2 mutations have not previously been identified in patients with acquired resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, although similar mutations were found to confer resistance to single-agent RAF inhibitors in a companion study. MEK2Q60P is homologous to MEK1Q56P, which confers resistance to monotherapy with RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in post-progression tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.  MEK2Q60P conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signalÐregulated kinase (ERK). Compared with parental controls and cells expressing wild-type MEK2, the MEK2Q60P mutation conferred profound resistance to the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib (Fig. 2A), as well as to single-agent dabrafenib (Fig. 2B) and trametinib (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, MEK2Q60P did not confer resistance to treatment with an extracellular signalÐregulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (Fig. 2D), which targets the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK1/2. Cells expressing MEK2Q60P exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 at baseline and when treated with dabrafenib/trametinib than wild-type A375 cells or those expressing wild-type MEK2 (Fig. 2E), indicative of enhanced MAPK pathway activation despite combined therapeutic blockade of this pathway.

We dissected the underlying molecular mechanism using various Gab2 mutants and kinase inhibitors and identified the Shp2/Ras/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axes as the two critical signaling pathways. Gab2-mediated TKI resistance was associated with persistent phosphorylation of Gab2 Y452, a PI3K recruitment site, and consistent with this finding, the protective effect of Gab2 was completely abolished by the combination of dasatinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.

Whereas the activation of STAT3 by Src has been previously described in vitro, , we showed that FRK mutants induce STAT3 activation in vitro, in vivo, and in human tumors.  In addition, the dramatic response to the Src inhibitor dasatinib in vitro and in vivo supports FRK-activating mutations as a paradigm of a mutated gene addiction. In Ba/F3 cells, IL-3-independent growth induced by FRK mutant was abrogated by dasatinib treatment ( Figure 3C). Subcutaneous injection of Ba/F3 cells with stable expression of the VK FRK mutant in nude mice resulted in tumor growth. Furthermore daily intraperitoneal injections of dasatinib (10 mg/kg/day) after subcutaneous tumor development and during 14 days led to a complete regression of the tumors (n = 9; Figures 3F and 3G; Figure S2I).

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients.

This structural variation comprised an identical 2,903-bp genomic deletion that was common to all three resistant samples. The 2.9-kb deleted region contains cis elements that suppress the splicing of BIM exon 3, which, in cells harboring the deletion, results in preferential splicing of exon 3 over exon 4. This polymorphism has a profound effect on the TKI sensitivity of CML and EGFR NSCLC cells, such that one copy of the deleted allele is sufficient to render cells intrinsically TKI resistant.

Because neurofibromin negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, we showed that pharmacologic mTOR inhibition in vivo led to decreased tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion associated with a decrease in tumor volume. Tumor proliferation was strongly inhibited by 5 mg/kg/d rapamycin treatment with a return to baseline following removal of drug. However, 20 mg/kg/d rapamycin treatment led to a sustained reduction in proliferation.

Specifically, introduction of a subset of the mutations identified in human GBM, in the nSH2 and iSH2 domains, increases signaling through the PI3K pathway and promotes tumorigenesis of primary normal human astrocytes in an orthotopic xenograft model. Furthermore, we show that cells that are dependent on mutant P85alpha mediated PI3K signaling exhibit increased sensitivity to a small molecule inhibitor of AKT. Together, these results suggest that GBM patients whose tumors carry mutant PIK3R1 alleles may benefit from treatment with inhibitors of AKT. It is conceivable that in the context of mutation of both PIK3R1 and PTEN, for example, that GBM cells may be sensitive to other inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, or of entirely independent pathways. (2) We have used loss-of-function RNAi screens of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to identify sensitizers of mTOR inhibition. RNAi screens conducted in combination with rapamycin in multiple breast cancer cell lines identified six genes, AURKB, PLK1, PIK3R1, MAPK12, PRKD2, and PTK6 that when silenced, each enhanced the sensitivity of multiple breast cancer lines to rapamycin.

PEComas demonstrated loss of TSC2 protein expression and evidence of baseline mTORC1 activation. Homozygous loss of TSC1 was identified in one PEComa.  Inhibition of mTORC1, pathologically activated by loss of the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex, is a rational mechanistic target for therapy in PEComas.

We first validated the Nf1 optic glioma model using conventional single agent chemotherapy (temozolomide) currently used for children with low grade glioma and showed that treatment resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo as well as reduced tumor volume. Because neurofibromin negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, we showed that pharmacologic mTOR inhibition in vivo led to decreased tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion associated with a decrease in tumor volume. Tumor proliferation was strongly inhibited by 5 mg/kg/d rapamycin treatment with a return to baseline following removal of drug. However, 20 mg/kg/d rapamycin treatment led to a sustained reduction in proliferation.

Specifically, introduction of a subset of the mutations identified in human GBM, in the nSH2 and iSH2 domains, increases signaling through the PI3K pathway and promotes tumorigenesis of primary normal human astrocytes in an orthotopic xenograft model. Furthermore, we show that cells that are dependent on mutant P85alpha mediated PI3K signaling exhibit increased sensitivity to a small molecule inhibitor of AKT. Together, these results suggest that GBM patients whose tumors carry mutant PIK3R1 alleles may benefit from treatment with inhibitors of AKT. It is conceivable that in the context of mutation of both PIK3R1 and PTEN, for example, that GBM cells may be sensitive to other inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, or of entirely independent pathways. (2) We have used loss-of-function RNAi screens of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to identify sensitizers of mTOR inhibition. RNAi screens conducted in combination with rapamycin in multiple breast cancer cell lines identified six genes, AURKB, PLK1, PIK3R1, MAPK12, PRKD2, and PTK6 that when silenced, each enhanced the sensitivity of multiple breast cancer lines to rapamycin.

These mutations were not detected in primary or treatment-naive ER(+) cancer or in any stage of ER(-) disease. Together, five ESR1 mutants were identified in this study (encoding p.Leu536Gln, p.Tyr537Ser, p.Asp538Gly, p.Tyr537Cys and p.Tyr573Asn alterations). Functional studies in cell line models demonstrate that these mutations render estrogen receptor constitutive activity and confer partial resistance to currently available endocrine treatments.  As expected, wild-type ESR1 was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen, fulvestrant and endoxifen (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 4Ð6).

We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients.

NF1 targeting shRNA constructs decreased sensitivity to erlotinib, with a 26-fold increase in the drug concentration required for an absolute survival inhibition of 50% (IC50) for shNF1#1 and 56-fold for shNF1#2 (Figure 3A) as determined by Cell Titer Blue measurement. Treatment of neurofibromin-deficient lung cancers with a MEK inhibitor restored sensitivity to erlotinib. Low levels of NF1 expression were associated with primary and acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to EGFR TKIs in patients. Using RNA sequencing data from a separate set of three human lung adenocarcinomas treated with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib), we identified reduced NF1expression in all three post-treatment tumours, with the strongest reduction in the two EGFR-TKI resistant samples that did not express T790M (V1 and V3) and failed to respond to a second-line treatment with afatinib (Figure 7B).

MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF- betaR2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF- betaR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF- beta signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers."	SNVs should be loss-of-function.

NF1 targeting shRNA constructs decreased sensitivity to erlotinib, with a 26-fold increase in the drug concentration required for an absolute survival inhibition of 50% (IC50) for shNF1#1 and 56-fold for shNF1#2 (Figure 3A) as determined by Cell Titer Blue measurement. Treatment of neurofibromin-deficient lung cancers with a MEK inhibitor restored sensitivity to erlotinib. Low levels of NF1 expression were associated with primary and acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to EGFR TKIs in patients. Using RNA sequencing data from a separate set of three human lung adenocarcinomas treated with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib), we identified reduced NF1 expression in all three post-treatment tumours, with the strongest reduction in the two EGFR-TKI resistant samples that did not express T790M (V1 and V3) and failed to respond to a second-line treatment with afatinib (Figure 7B). Experiments with the PC9 cell line confirmed that NF1 silencing strongly reduced sensitivity to afatinib as well (Figure S7A)."	"drug class association with Erlotinib.

To test whether ibrutinib can elicit in vivo antitumor activity in EGFR-mutant tumors, we established xenograft tumors from H1975 cells in nude mice and treated mice daily with ibrutinib (25mg/kg), erlotinib (50mg/kg), or solvent when tumors reached 4 to 5mm in diameters. The result showed that treatment with ibrutinib, but not erlotinib, statistically significantly suppressed H1975 tumor growth and prolonged survival of the tumor-bearing mice (Figure 1, C and D). While the mean survival times for solvent- and erlotinib-treated mice were both 17.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.3 to 21.3 days), the mean survival time for ibrutinib-treated mice was 29.8 days (95% CI = 26.0 to 33.6 days, P = .008), demonstrating in vivo efficacy of ibrutinib in EGFR-mutant cancer."

All 18 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received the recommended phase 2 dose had an overall response. For those subtyped and treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, five (71 percent) of seven patients with the germinal centre B-cell-like subtype and two (100 percent) patients with the non-germinal centre B-cell-like subtype had a complete response. R-CHOP did not affect pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib, and ibrutinib did not alter the pharmacokinetics of vincristine.

Here, we grew breakpoint cluster region/Abelson murine leukemia (Bcr/Abl) P190 lymphoblasts on stroma and made them resistant to the FTI SCH66336/lonafarnib to model emerging drug resistance in a patient. These cells exhibited greatly increased (> 100-fold) expression levels of a novel ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-homologous gene, ATP11A. We showed that overexpression of this gene provided protection against the effects of SCH66336, whereas knockdown of endogenous ATP11a using small interfering RNA (siRNA) made cells more sensitive to this drug. The lymphoblasts that were resistant to this FTI were also more resistant to FTI-276 and to GGTI-298, 2 other structurally similar inhibitors. Surprisingly, the cells were also able to survive higher concentrations of imatinib mesylate, the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor."	unspecified	"Zhang B, Blood 2005, 106:1355-1361"	leukemia

We dissected the underlying molecular mechanism using various Gab2 mutants and kinase inhibitors and identified the Shp2/Ras/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axes as the two critical signaling pathways. Gab2-mediated TKI resistance was associated with persistent phosphorylation of Gab2 Y452, a PI3K recruitment site, and consistent with this finding, the protective effect of Gab2 was completely abolished by the combination of dasatinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. The identification of Gab2 as a novel modulator of TKI sensitivity in CML suggests that Gab2 could be exploited as a biomarker and therapeutic target in TKI-resistant disease."	unspecified	"Wohrle F, Leukemia 2013, 27:118-1129"	CML

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1%) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g).

MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF- betaR2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF- betaR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF- beta signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers."	class association with erlotinib and gefitinib	"Huang S, Cell 2012, 151:937-950"	unspecified

Compared to WT ERBB4, all the missense mutants showed increased phosphorylation of the receptor (Figure 2A). Exposure of melanoma cells to lapatinib resulted in reduced cell proliferation to a greater extent in cells containing endogenous ERBB4 mutations than in cells containing endogenous WT ERBB4 (Figure 5A). An IC50 calculation revealed that melanoma cells harboring ERBB4 mutations were 10Ð250 fold more sensitive to lapatinib than cells with WT receptor (Figure 5B) and treatment with lapatinib inhibited receptor autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5C).

Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond toÊlorlatinibÊ(PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance toÊlorlatinibÊthrough steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib.

We dissected the underlying molecular mechanism using various Gab2 mutants and kinase inhibitors and identified the Shp2/Ras/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axes as the two critical signaling pathways. Gab2-mediated TKI resistance was associated with persistent phosphorylation of Gab2 Y452, a PI3K recruitment site, and consistent with this finding, the protective effect of Gab2 was completely abolished by the combination of dasatinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.

PTEN deficient cells including U87MG displayed an increased sensitivity to PARPi. Additionally, PARP inhibition strongly intensified HR deficiency in PTEN mutant cells, that had already compromised HR and repressed the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint protein BUBR1. BUBR1 was reduced after PARPi treatment in PTEN mutant cells. Gene expression of BUB1B (the gene coding for BUBR1) is very significantly up-regulated in GBM patients and its expression was inversely correlated with PTEN in short-survival patients.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors were ranked at or near the top of candidate compound lists in both screens. We show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors reverse the biochemical effects of BAP1 loss, induce melanocytic differentiation and cell-cycle arrest, and inhibit the growth of UM tumors in vivo in a xenograft model. When we stably depleted BAP1 in UM cells using lentiviral shRNA, VPA significantly reduced the fraction of viable cells compared with control cells, indicating that BAP1 loss sensitized the UM cells to HDAC inhibition.

A phase II trial is currently being conducted involving pazopanib combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOX) in AGC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01130805). Of 66 patients enrolled in this investigator-sponsored trial as of July 2014, 3 cases (7.1%) of 42 patients tested were found to have FGFR2 amplification by dual-color FISH. The complete clinical data of this trial will be available in the late 2014, and the significance of FGFR2 amplification and other biomarkers on clinical outcomes in this context of the trial will be also investigated.

We report the case of a 67-yr-old woman who presented with intermittent gross hematuria. Cystoscopy showed a sessile bladder tumor, and biopsy demonstrated high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma.  The patient received four cycles of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC regimen) chemotherapy. Her course was complicated by neutropenic fever, and subsequent imaging showed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid TumorÐdefined progression, with multiple new pulmonary nodules emerging. The patient then received a combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide, complicated by both neutropenic fever and renal impairment with no documented response. This was followed by sequential therapy with paclitaxel followed by methotrexate, gemcitabine, and cyclophosphamide. The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cystectomy specimen was submitted for genomic profiling. The tumor harbored amplification of FGFR3 (11 copies), CCND1 (21 copies), and FGF19 (21 copies) and an FGFR3 S249C mutation with estimated mutant allele frequencies of 58%. On the basis of these findings, the patient was initiated on pazopanib. After 3 mo of therapy, the patient achieved a partial response (PR) that has been maintained for >6 mo of follow-up. The present case underscores the potential value of genomic profiling in advanced urothelial carcinoma. "	unspecified	"Palma N, Eur Urol 2015, Epub"	Urothelial cancer

We evaluated the effects of ponatinib in endometrial cancer cell lines that express FGFR2 with either an activating mutation in the kinase domain (N549K; AN3CA and MFE-296 cells) or a mutation that increases ligand binding (S252W; MFE-280 cells; refs. 16, 17). Ponatinib inhibited growth of AN3CA and MFE-296 cells with GI50 values of 14 and 61 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A). The S252W mutation, in the extracellular region of FGFR2, does not lead to constitutive FGFR2 phosphorylation but does increase ligand-binding affinity (28); therefore, we evaluated the effects of ponatinib on MFE-280 cells grown in the presence of FGF2. Under these conditions, ponatinib inhibited growth with a GI50 value of 35 nmol/L (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ponatinib did not potently inhibit growth of endometrial cancer cells (RL95-2) that do not contain mutated FGFR2 (GI50 > 300 nmol/L; Fig. 2A; ref. 17). To examine the effect of ponatinib on growth of FGFR2N549K mutant cells in vivo, ponatinib or vehicle was administered orally once daily for 11 days to mice bearing AN3CA xenografts. As shown in Fig. 2C, tumor growth was not substantially inhibited in mice dosed with 3 mg/kg ponatinib. In contrast, growth was inhibited by 49% in mice dosed with 10 mg/kg and by 82% (P < 0.05) in mice dosed with 30 mg/kg. To confirm target modulation in vivo, mice bearing AN3CA xenografts were treated with a single oral dose of ponatinib or vehicle and tumors harvested 6 hours later. Consistent with the effects of ponatinib on tumor growth, dose-dependent effects on target phosphorylation were observed and were associated with increasing plasma levels of ponatinib. While partial inhibition of FGFR2 and FRS2alpha phosphorylation was observed after a 3 mg/kg dose, more than 80% inhibition was observed after doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg (Fig. 2D).

Higher microvessel density was found in sunitinib-resistant tumors, indicating that an escape from antiangiogenesis occurred. Notably, escape coincided with increased secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) from tumors into the plasma, and coadministration of an IL-8 neutralizing antibody resensitized tumors to sunitinib treatment. In patients who were refractory to sunitinib treatment, IL-8 expression was elevated in ccRCC tumors, supporting the concept that IL-8 levels might predict clinical response to sunitinib. Our results reveal IL-8 as an important contributor to sunitinib resistance in ccRCC and a candidate therapeutic target to reverse acquired or intrinsic resistance to sunitinib in this malignancy"	unspecified	"Huang D, Cancer Res 2010, 70:1063-1071"	renal cell carcinoma

Because neurofibromin negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, we showed that pharmacologic mTOR inhibition in vivo led to decreased tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion associated with a decrease in tumor volume. Tumor proliferation was strongly inhibited by 5 mg/kg/d rapamycin treatment with a return to baseline following removal of drug.

Specifically, introduction of a subset of the mutations identified in human GBM, in the nSH2 and iSH2 domains, increases signaling through the PI3K pathway and promotes tumorigenesis of primary normal human astrocytes in an orthotopic xenograft model. Furthermore, we show that cells that are dependent on mutant P85alpha mediated PI3K signaling exhibit increased sensitivity to a small molecule inhibitor of AKT. Together, these results suggest that GBM patients whose tumors carry mutant PIK3R1 alleles may benefit from treatment with inhibitors of AKT. It is conceivable that in the context of mutation of both PIK3R1 and PTEN, for example, that GBM cells may be sensitive to other inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, or of entirely independent pathways. (2) We have used loss-of-function RNAi screens of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to identify sensitizers of mTOR inhibition. RNAi screens conducted in combination with rapamycin in multiple breast cancer cell lines identified six genes, AURKB, PLK1, PIK3R1, MAPK12, PRKD2, and PTK6 that when silenced, each enhanced the sensitivity of multiple breast cancer lines to rapamycin.

Because neurofibromin negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, we showed that pharmacologic mTOR inhibition in vivo led to decreased tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion associated with a decrease in tumor volume. Tumor proliferation was strongly inhibited by 5 mg/kg/d rapamycin treatment with a return to baseline following removal of drug.

We first validated the Nf1 optic glioma model using conventional single agent chemotherapy (temozolomide) currently used for children with low grade glioma and showed that treatment resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo as well as reduced tumor volume. Because neurofibromin negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, we showed that pharmacologic mTOR inhibition in vivo led to decreased tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion associated with a decrease in tumor volume. Tumor proliferation was strongly inhibited by 5 mg/kg/d rapamycin treatment with a return to baseline following removal of drug. However, 20 mg/kg/d rapamycin treatment led to a sustained reduction in proliferation.

Specifically, introduction of a subset of the mutations identified in human GBM, in the nSH2 and iSH2 domains, increases signaling through the PI3K pathway and promotes tumorigenesis of primary normal human astrocytes in an orthotopic xenograft model. Furthermore, we show that cells that are dependent on mutant P85alpha mediated PI3K signaling exhibit increased sensitivity to a small molecule inhibitor of AKT. Together, these results suggest that GBM patients whose tumors carry mutant PIK3R1 alleles may benefit from treatment with inhibitors of AKT. It is conceivable that in the context of mutation of both PIK3R1 and PTEN, for example, that GBM cells may be sensitive to other inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, or of entirely independent pathways. (2) We have used loss-of-function RNAi screens of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to identify sensitizers of mTOR inhibition. RNAi screens conducted in combination with rapamycin in multiple breast cancer cell lines identified six genes, AURKB, PLK1, PIK3R1, MAPK12, PRKD2, and PTK6 that when silenced, each enhanced the sensitivity of multiple breast cancer lines to rapamycin.

Whole-exome sequencing of a urothelial cancer patient with a 14-month complete response on this trial revealed two concurrent mutations in mTOR, the target of everolimus. Examination of the sequencing data for biologically plausible mechanisms of sensitivity to everolimus or pazopanib revealed two mutations in mTOR, the target of everolimus ( Fig. 2 ). One mutation, mTOR E2419K is a well-described activating mutation in the kinase domain of mTOR, even though it has not been identified in human cancer to date. The second mutation we identified, mTOR E2014K, occurs in the FKBPÐrapamycin-binding (FRB) domain of mTOR. As shown in Fig. 2C , overexpression of mTOR E2419K or mTOR E2014K individually resulted in increased phosphorylation of S6K1 as compared with wildtype mTOR ( Fig. 2C , lanes 4 and 7 compared with lane 1).  As shown in Fig. 2C , treatment with 0.1 micromol/L of rapamycin completely abrogated S6K1 phosphorylation by both wild-type and mutant mTOR, suggesting that these mutations remain highly sensitive to allosteric inhibition."

Combined YAP and RAF or MEK inhibition was synthetically lethal not only in several BRAF-mutant tumor types but also in RAS-mutant tumors. We assessed whether YAP expression was inversely correlated with the initial response to RAF and MEK inhibition in patients with BRAF V600E (n = 35). Patients with melanoma harboring BRAF V600E who had a complete response to therapy exhibited lower YAP expression in the pretreatment tumor samples (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 6). Conversely, patients who had an incomplete response to therapy had higher YAP expression in the baseline tumor samples (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 6). We also assessed YAP levels in melanomas obtained from patients at the time of progression on RAF or MEK inhibitor therapy after an initial response to test the hypothesis that YAP might contribute to acquired resistance. We examined YAP expression by immunohistochemistry in an additional 32 paired melanoma specimens with BRAF V600E obtained from 16 patients both before RAF or MEK inhibitor treatment and upon the development of acquired resistance. As the majority of the pretreatment melanoma specimens encoding BRAF V600E from patients harbored high baseline YAP levels (Supplementary Table 7), we examined whether YAP levels were higher at the time of progression in the subset of patients whose pretreatment tumors had low or intermediate YAP levels (25%, 4/16 cases; Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 7). We found increased YAP levels in each paired tumor obtained at acquired resistance in comparison to the matched pretreatment specimen (Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 7).

Combined YAP and RAF or MEK inhibition was synthetically lethal not only in several BRAF-mutant tumor types but also in RAS-mutant tumors. We assessed whether YAP expression was inversely correlated with the initial response to RAF and MEK inhibition in patients with BRAF V600E (n = 35). Patients with melanoma harboring BRAF V600E who had a complete response to therapy exhibited lower YAP expression in the pretreatment tumor samples (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 6). Conversely, patients who had an incomplete response to therapy had higher YAP expression in the baseline tumor samples (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 6). We also assessed YAP levels in melanomas obtained from patients at the time of progression on RAF or MEK inhibitor therapy after an initial response to test the hypothesis that YAP might contribute to acquired resistance. We examined YAP expression by immunohistochemistry in an additional 32 paired melanoma specimens with BRAF V600E obtained from 16 patients both before RAF or MEK inhibitor treatment and upon the development of acquired resistance. As the majority of the pretreatment melanoma specimens encoding BRAF V600E from patients harbored high baseline YAP levels (Supplementary Table 7), we examined whether YAP levels were higher at the time of progression in the subset of patients whose pretreatment tumors had low or intermediate YAP levels (25%, 4/16 cases; Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 7).

However, growth inhibition occurred only in a subset of NF1-deficient cells, in association with decreased levels of cyclin D1, increased levels of p27, and G1 arrest. As a single agent, PD0325901 suppressed the growth of NF1-deficient, MEK inhibitor-sensitive cells in vivo as well. Mechanistically, NF1-deficient, MEK inhibitor-sensitive cells were dependent upon the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway for growth and did not activate the PI3K pathway as a mechanism of acquired resistance. Importantly, NF1-deficient cells intrinsically resistant to MEK inhibition were sensitized by the addition of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103. Together, these data suggest that NF1-deficient GBMs are an ideal target for MEK inhibitors or MEK inhibitor based combination therapies.

MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF- betaR2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF- betaR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF- beta signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers."	class association with selumetinib	"Huang S, Cell 2012, 151:937-950"	unspecified

However, growth inhibition occurred only in a subset of NF1-deficient cells, in association with decreased levels of cyclin D1, increased levels of p27, and G1 arrest. As a single agent, PD0325901 suppressed the growth of NF1-deficient, MEK inhibitor-sensitive cells in vivo as well. Mechanistically, NF1-deficient, MEK inhibitor-sensitive cells were dependent upon the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway for growth and did not activate the PI3K pathway as a mechanism of acquired resistance. Importantly, NF1-deficient cells intrinsically resistant to MEK inhibition were sensitized by the addition of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103. Together, these data suggest that NF1-deficient GBMs are an ideal target for MEK inhibitors or MEK inhibitor based combination therapies.

We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients.

Because this mutation is located in the activating kinase domain of BRAF, and given the results of the chemosensitivity and signaling assays, the patient (patient 1) was treated with 480 mg vemurafenib twice per day (because of a cutaneous drug-induced reaction with 960 mg vemurafenib twice per day). Computed tomography scans were obtained before (Figs 3A and 3C) and on day 60 of treatment (Figs 3B and 3D). The largest diameter of the subcutaneous nodule on the right infraspinatus fossa decreased 30%, from 30 mm to 20 mm (Figs 3A and 3B), the largest diameter of the right inferior lobe pulmonary nodule decreased 30%, from 18 mm to 12 mm (Figs 3C and 3D), and the left fissural pulmonary nodule decreased 50%, from 10 mm to 5 mm (not shown).

Combined YAP and RAF or MEK inhibition was synthetically lethal not only in several BRAF-mutant tumor types but also in RAS-mutant tumors. We assessed whether YAP expression was inversely correlated with the initial response to RAF and MEK inhibition in patients with BRAF V600E (n = 35). Patients with melanoma harboring BRAF V600E who had a complete response to therapy exhibited lower YAP expression in the pretreatment tumor samples (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 6). Conversely, patients who had an incomplete response to therapy had higher YAP expression in the baseline tumor samples (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 6). We also assessed YAP levels in melanomas obtained from patients at the time of progression on RAF or MEK inhibitor therapy after an initial response to test the hypothesis that YAP might contribute to acquired resistance. We examined YAP expression by immunohistochemistry in an additional 32 paired melanoma specimens with BRAF V600E obtained from 16 patients both before RAF or MEK inhibitor treatment and upon the development of acquired resistance. As the majority of the pretreatment melanoma specimens encoding BRAF V600E from patients harbored high baseline YAP levels (Supplementary Table 7), we examined whether YAP levels were higher at the time of progression in the subset of patients whose pretreatment tumors had low or intermediate YAP levels (25%, 4/16 cases; Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 7). We found increased YAP levels in each paired tumor obtained at acquired resistance in comparison to the matched pretreatment specimen (Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 7). These findings further suggest that increased YAP levels might limit the clinical efficacy of RAF and MEK inhibitors."	unspecified	"Lin L, Nat Genet 2015, 47:250-256"	melanoma

We assessed whether YAP expression was inversely correlated with the initial response to RAF and MEK inhibition in patients with BRAF V600E (n = 35).

MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF- betaR2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF- betaR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF- beta signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers."	SNVs should be loss-of-function.

We found that depletion of the tumor suppressor BAP1 reduced HDAC2 expression, acting at the level of transcription rather than ubiquitylation. HDAC2 depleted cells were sensitized to both HDAC inhibitors (vorinostat, mocetinostat), with significantly decreased viability compared to DMSO alone. Importantly, BAP1 knockdown also increased sensitivity to HDAC inhibition in a similar fashion, decreasing cell survival with both vorinostat and mocetinostat. Our work establishes a mechanism by which BAP1 loss alters sensitivity of cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors.

Analysis of HR23B levels in CTCL biopsies suggest HR23B has considerable promise as an informative biomarker for HDAC inhibitors. 	unspecified	"Khan O, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2010, 107:6532-6537"	cutaneous T cell lymphoma

As proof-of-concept to evaluate the contribution of Bax and Bak to HDI-mediated apoptosis, we found that apoptosis was unaffected in HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells lacking Bak, blunted in cells lacking Bax, and nearly completely abrogated in cells lacking both Bak and Bax compared with wild-type cells. We thus conclude that HDI-mediated and AKI-mediated apoptosis requires mitochondrial engagement, and that baseline Bax and Bak expression may serve as biomarkers for patients with Burkitt lymphoma likely to respond to HDI treatment.

We found that depletion of the tumor suppressor BAP1 reduced HDAC2 expression, acting at the level of transcription rather than ubiquitylation. HDAC2 depleted cells were sensitized to both HDAC inhibitors (vorinostat, mocetinostat), with significantly decreased viability compared to DMSO alone. Importantly, BAP1 knockdown also increased sensitivity to HDAC inhibition in a similar fashion, decreasing cell survival with both vorinostat and mocetinostat. Our work establishes a mechanism by which BAP1 loss alters sensitivity of cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors. Assessment of BAP1 and HDAC expression may ultimately help identify patients likely to respond to HDAC inhibitors."	"SNVs should be loss-of-function and associated with drug sensitivity.
