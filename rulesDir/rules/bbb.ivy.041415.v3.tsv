Abiraterone acetate	CYP17	Abiraterone is an orally active inhibitor of the steroidal enzyme CYP17A1 (17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20 lyase). It inhibits CYP17A1 in a selective and irreversible manner via covalent binding mechanism. CYP17A1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of androgen and is highly expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissue. More specifically, abiraterone inhibits the conversion of 17-hydroxyprognenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by the enzyme CYP17A1 to decrease serum levels of testosterone and other androgens.

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine 	HER2 and chemotherapy (DM1)	Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a HER2 antibody drug conjugate. The antibody portion is trastuzumab, which is humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, and produced in the mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The drug portion is DM1, which is a maytansine derivative that inhibits microtubules. These two portions are covalently connected by 4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC), which is a stable thioether linker. Together MCC and DM1 are called emtansine and are produced by chemical synthesis. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine binds to the HER2 receptor’s sub-domain IV and goes into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Lysosomes degrade ado-trastuzumab emtansine and release DM1. DM1 binds to tubulin in microtubules and inhibits microtubule function producing cell arrest and apoptosis. As well, similar to trastuzumab, in vitro studies have shown that both HER2 receptor signalling inhibition and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity are mediated by ado-trastuzumab emtansine.

Auranofin	Thioredoxin reductase	Auranofin interacts with selenocysteine residue within the redox-active domain of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), thereby blocking the activity of TrxR. As a result, this agent induces mitochondrial oxidative stress leading to the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, this agent strongly inhibits the JAK1/STAT3 signal transduction pathway, thereby suppressing expression of immune factors involved in inflammation. TrxR, overexpressed in many cancer cell types, inhibits apoptosis, promotes cell growth and survival and plays a role in resistance to chemotherapy; TrxR catalyzes the reduction of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx) and plays a central role in regulating cellular redox homeostasis.

During the 1st h of exposure a more or less steady-state situation in axitinib brain/plasma ratios [<0.1] has been established that is in part determined by Abcb1 and/or Abcg2 activity and that does not dramatically change between 1 and 4 h, as the plasma levels of axitinib drop. Concomitant administration of axitinib with inhibitors of ABCB1 and/or ABCG2 might thus be a promising approach to enhancing axitinib brain and brain tumor cell accumulation or to overcoming ABCB1-mediated drug resistance.  Mouse whole-body autoradiography revealed that [(14)C]axitinib-equivalents showed rapid absorption and distribution to all tissues except the brain. This suggests that efflux transport of axitinib may occur at the mouse blood-brain barrier. 	NO	3.536928571	NEUTRAL	yes	ABCB1	unspecified	We studied axitinib transport using Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells overexpressing human ABCB1 or ABCG2 or murine Abcg2. Axitinib was a good substrate of ABCB1 and Abcg2, whereas transport activity by ABCG2 was moderate. Relative brain accumulation of axitinib in Abcb1a/1b(-/-) and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice was, respectively, 6.8- and 13.9-fold higher than that in wild-type mice at 1 h and 4.9- and 20.7-fold at 4 h after axitinib administration. In Abcg2(-/-) mice, we found no significant differences in brain accumulation compared with those in wild-type mice. Thus, Abcb1 strongly restricts axitinib brain accumulation and completely compensates for the loss of Abcg2 at the blood-brain barrier, whereas Abcg2 can only partially take over Abcb1-mediated axitinib efflux. Hence, Abcg2 has a stronger impact on axitinib oral plasma pharmacokinetics, whereas Abcb1 is the more important transporter at the blood-brain barrier. These findings illustrate that in vitro transport data for ABCB1 and ABCG2 cannot always be simply extrapolated to the prediction of the relative impact of these transporters on oral availability versus brain penetration.	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21282407	Poller B, Drug Metab Dispos 2011, 39:729-735	yes	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Gastrointestinal events, Hemorrhage, Hypertension, Proteinuria, Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, Thrombotic events, Thyroid dysfunction, Wound healing complications	Amphotericin B, Cardiac Glycosides, CYP3A4 Inducers (Strong), CYP3A4 Inducers (Weakly to Moderately Effective), CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Moderate), CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong), Dabrafenib, Dasatinib, Deferasirox, Grapefruit Juice, Ivacaftor, Mifepristone, St Johns Wort, Tocilizumab, Vitamin K Antagonists	CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP3A4	unspecified	unspecified	FDA Approved	4.15	4.15	95.97	386.47	2	4.3	0.425	0	0.801	0.810928571	0.5	1	1	368.328	0.03	-0.585	2363.065	1293.317	0	Yes	SLCO1B1, UGT1A1	unspecified	Oral	Inlyta

Benzthiazide	Thiazide	Benzthiazide is used to treat hypertension and edema. Like other thiazides, benzthiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). They inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.

Cabazitaxel	Microtulbule inhibitor	Cabazitaxel is a taxane derivative similar to docetaxel and paclitaxel. Cabazitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor. Cabazitaxel binds to tubulin and promotes its assembly into microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting disassembly. This leads to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the interference of mitotic and interphase cellular functions. The cell is then unable to progress further into the cell cycle, being stalled at metaphase, thus triggering apoptosis of the cancer cell.

Clofarabine	Nucleoside analog	Clofarabine, a purine (deoxyadenosine) nucleoside analog, is metabolized to clofarabine 5'-triphosphate. Clofarabine 5'-triphosphate decreases cell replication and repair as well as causing cell death. To decrease cell replication and repair, clofarabine 5'-triphosphate competes with deoxyadenosine triphosphate for the enzymes ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase. Cell replication is decreased when clofarabine 5'-triphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase from reacting with deoxyadenosine triphosphate to produce deoxynucleotide triphosphate which is needed for DNA synthesis. Cell replication is also decreased when clofarabine 5'-triphosphate competes with DNA polymerase for incorporation into the DNA chain; when done during the repair process, cell repair is affected.

In vitro accumulation studies conducted in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells indicate that dabrafenib is an avid substrate for both P-gp and BCRP. Directional flux studies revealed greater transport in the basolateral to apical direction with corrected efflux ratios greater than 2 for both P-gp and Bcrp1 transfected cell lines. In vivo, the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)(brain) to AUC(plasma) (K(p)) of dabrafenib after an i.v. dose (2.5 mg/kg) was 0.023, which increased by 18-fold in Mdr1 a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice to 0.42. Dabrafenib plasma exposure was ∼2-fold greater in Mdr1 a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice as compared with wild-type with an oral dose (25 mg/kg); however, the brain distribution was increased by ~10-fold with a resulting K(p) of 0.25. Further, compared with vemurafenib, another BRAF(V600E) inhibitor, dabrafenib showed greater brain penetration with a similar dose.

The 5-day schedule appears less toxic, and pharmacokinetic studies show that it provides greater exposure to MTIC and HMMTIC compared to the one-day schedule.	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11212905	No FDA review documents available online;  European Medicines Agency: Dacarbazine crosses the blood-brain barrier to a limited extent; CSF concentrations are reported to be about 14% of plasma concentrations.	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12113120	Danson S, Expert Rev Anticancer Ther 2001, 1:13-19	European Medicines Agency: Dacarbazine crosses the blood-brain barrier to a limited extent; CSF concentrations are reported to be about 14% of plasma concentrations. There is evidence to suggest that temozolomide-treated patients have a lower incidence of intracranial disease than those treated with DTIC. A retrospective study looked at 40 patients with advanced melanoma, 19 were treated with temozolomide and 10% of these developed brain metastases, this compared with the 21 patients who had DTIC, 38% developed CNS relapse. There were significantly fewer (p = 0.0167) instances of CNS relapse in the group treated with temozolomide. This corresponds with our knowledge that temozolomide can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, unlike the breakdown product of DTIC.

The brain penetration index (ratio of dose-normalized AUC in the brain to plasma) was 0.55 for eribulin and >1 for analogs, with estimates as high as 7.7. Thus, amelioration of P-gp mediated efflux indeed led to increased brain penetration as compared to eribulin. Taken together, these data suggest that the compounds synthesized in this study provide significantly high levels of brain exposure, and may therefore be suitable for treatment of brain tumors.

(2) We show that erlotinib transport across an intact BBB is significantly restricted due to P-gp- and Bcrp-mediated efflux transport. We then show that the BBB is sufficiently intact in areas of brain adjacent to the tumor core to significantly restrict erlotinib delivery. Inhibition of P-gp and Bcrp by the dual inhibitor elacridar dramatically increased erlotinib delivery to the tumor core, rim, and normal brain.

The Vd values for doxorubicin and etoposide were low and remained relatively constant over the same period, indicating little uptake of unconjugated drugs into total brain tissue. The slopes of the curves, which correspond to the BBB influx rate constants (Kin), are presented in Table 4. The Kin for 2 (31 ± 0.7 × 10−4 mL/g/s) was 12.4-fold greater than unconjugated doxorubicin (2.5 ± 0.1 × 10−4 mL/g/s), while the Kin for 3 (22 ± 0.2 × 10−4 mL/g/s) was 24.4-fold greater than unconjugated etoposide (0.9 ± 0.1 × 10−4 mL/g/s). Thus, both new Angiopep-2 drug conjugates exhibited dramatically higher BBB influx rate constants than their unconjugated precursors, consistent with an enhanced ability to cross the BBB.

Floxuridine	Anti-metabolite	Floxuridine is rapidly catabolized to 5-fluorouracil, which is the active form of the drug. The primary effect is interference with DNA synthesis and to a lesser extent, inhibition of RNA formation through the drug's incorporation into RNA, thus leading to the production of fraudulent RNA. Fluorouracil also inhibits uracil riboside phophorylase, which prevents the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. As well, the monophosphate of floxuridine, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthetase. This leads to the inhibition of methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thus interfering with DNA synthesis.

Gallium nitrate	Inorganic compound	Gallium nitrate exerts hypocalcemic effect by inhibiting calcium resorption from bone, possibly by stabilizing bone matrix, thereby reducing increased bone turnover. Gallium nitrate inhibits the growth of various lymphoma cell lines in vitro and exhibits antitumor activity in patients with lymphoma. The mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity is (are) only partly understood but appears to involve a two-step process: (1) targeting of gallium to cells, and (2) acting on multiple, specific intracellular processes. Gallium shares certain chemical properties with iron; therefore, it binds avidly to the iron transport protein transferrin. Transferrin-gallium complexes preferentially target cells that express transferrin receptors on their surface. Expression of transferrin receptors is particularly high on lymphoma cells. Cellular uptake of the gallium-transferrin complex leads to inhibition of cellular proliferation primarily via disruption of iron transport and homeostasis and blockade of ribonucleotide reductase. Recent studies have shown that cellular uptake of gallium leads to activation of caspases and induction of apoptosis. In phase II trials in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, the antitumor activity of gallium nitrate is similar to, or better than, that of other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents.

Imiquimod	TLR7 agonist	Imiquimod's mechanism of action is via stimulation of innate and acquired immune responses, which ultimately leads to inflammatory cell infiltration within the field of drug application followed by apoptosis of diseased tissue. Imiquimod does not have direct antiviral activity. Studies of mice show that imiquimod may induce cytokines, including interferon-alpha (IFNA) as well as several IFNA genes (IFNA1, IFNA2, IFNA5, IFNA6, and IFNA8) as well as the IFNB gene. Imiquimod also induced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha genes. In the treatment of basal cell carcinoma, Imiquimod appears to act as a toll-like receptor-7 agonist, and is thought to exert its anti-tumor effect via modification of the immune response and stimulation of apoptosis in BCC cells. In treating basal cell carcinoma it may increase the infiltration of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages into the tumor lesion.

Lithium	Mood stabilizing agent	The precise mechanism of action of Li+ as a mood-stabilizing agent is currently unknown. It is possible that Li+ produces its effects by interacting with the transport of monovalent or divalent cations in neurons. An increasing number of scientists have come to the conclusion that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is the key factor in understanding how lithium works. Lithium has been shown to change the inward and outward currents of glutamate receptors (especially GluR3), without a shift in reversal potential. Lithium has been found to exert a dual effect on glutamate receptors, acting to keep the amount of glutamate active between cells at a stable, healthy level, neither too much nor too little. It is postulated that too much glutamate in the space between neurons causes mania, and too little, depression. Another mechanism by which lithium might help to regulate mood include the non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme called inositol monophosphatase. Alternately lithium's action may be enhanced through the deactivation of the GSK-3B enzyme. The regulation of GSK-3B by lithium may affect the circadian clock. GSK-3 is known for phosphorylating and thus inactivating glycogen synthase. GSK-3B has also been implicated in the control of cellular response to damaged DNA. GSK-3 normally phosphorylates beta catenin, which leads to beta catenin degratation. When GSK-3 is inhibited, beta catenin increases and transgenic mice with overexpression of beta catenin express similar behaviour to mice treated with lithium. These results suggest that increase of beta catenin may be a possible pathway for the therapeutic action of lithium.

The brain/serum lithium concentration ratio varied considerably during the 48-hr period, ranging from 0.5 to 1.3, but the ratio was independent of the serum-lithium concentration. The median half-life for lithium was 28 hr in the brain, and 16 hr in serum.

Losartan	Angiotensin II receptor antagonist	The potassium salt of losartan, a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist with antihypertensive activity. Losartan selectively and competitively binds to the angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) and blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the receptor, thus promoting vasodilatation and counteracting the effects of aldosterone. Converted from angiotensin I by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II stimulates the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete aldosterone, decreasing sodium excretion and increasing potassium excretion, and acts as a vasoconstrictor in vascular smooth muscle.

Lovastatin	HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor	A lactone metabolite isolated from the fungus Aspergillus terreus with cholesterol-lowering and potential antineoplastic activities. Lovastatin is hydrolyzed to the active beta-hydroxyacid form, which competitively inhibits 3-hydroxyl-3-methylgutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, this agent may induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell invasiveness, possibly by inhibiting protein farnesylation and protein geranylgeranylation, and may arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

Mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last statin administration, cerebral cortex dissected and statin levels were determined by LC-MS/MS. Relatively low levels of simvastatin and lovastatin lactones were detected but pravastatin was not detected in the cerebral cortex 24 h after the last drug administration. The low levels of simvastatin and lovastatin and the absence of pravastatin at 24 h were puzzling because of the significant effects of all 3 statins on brain gene expression. To begin to examine the possibility that statins did not accumulate in brain, we examined statins levels in mice given a single administration and then sacrificed at 1, 3, and 6 h following drug administration. Simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin were all detected in the cerebral cortex. Not surprisingly, brain levels of the three statins reflected their lipophilicity with simvastatin levels >lovastatin levels> pravastatin levels. Statins are substrates for P-gp and this transporter may play a role in statin efflux from cells. P-gp is a major component of the blood-brain-barrier and it is located in different brain cell types including neurons. P-gp could act as a transporter both at the blood-brain barrier and neuronal cells.

A significantly higher (p < 0.05) brain penetration in the KO compared with the WT mice was observed for lovastatin acid (but the brain/plasma ratio was low for both KO and WT mice) and lactone and simvastatin lactone but not for atorvastatin or pravastatin. The present results suggest that mouse P-glycoprotein does not affect the lactone-acid interconversion or liver-plasma distribution. Furthermore, P-glycoprotein plays a limited role in restricting the brain penetration of the acid forms of atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin lactone but may limit the brain availability of the lactone forms of simvastatin and lovastatin.	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17640956	Chen C, Drug Metab Dispos 2007, 35:1725-1729	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Diabetes mellitus, Hepatotoxicity, Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, Myopathy/rhabdomyolysis	Amiodarone, Antacids, Aripiprazole, Azithromycin (Systemic), Bezafibrate, Boceprevir, Bosentan, Clarithromycin, Colchicine, Cyclosporine (Systemic), CYP3A4 Inducers (Strong), CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Moderate), CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong), Cyproterone, Dabrafenib, Danazol, Daptomycin, Dasatinib, Deferasirox, Diltiazem, Dofetilide, Dronedarone, Efavirenz, Erythromycin (Systemic), Etravirine, Fenofibrate, Fenofibric Acid, Fluconazole, Fosphenytoin, Fusidic Acid, Gemfibrozil, Grapefruit Juice, Ivacaftor, Lanthanum, Lomitapide, Mifepristone, Niacin, Niacinamide, P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inducers, P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inhibitors, Pazopanib, Phenytoin, Pimozide, Protease Inhibitors, Proton Pump Inhibitors, Quinine, Ranolazine, Red Yeast Rice, Rifamycin Derivatives, Sildenafil, Sitagliptin, St Johns Wort, Telaprevir, Telithromycin, Ticagrelor, Tocilizumab, Trabectedin, Verapamil, Vitamin K Antagonists 	CYP3A4	CYP2C9, CYP3A4	unspecified	FDA Approved	4.07	4.07	73	405	1	0	0.465	0	1	0.678571429	0.833333333	1	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	SLCO1A2; SLCO1B1	Oral	Mevacor

In this study, we used the model of inflammation evoked by single or chronic intraperitoneal (ip) injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to assess the changes in metformin levels in the brain structures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma after oral metformin administration (150 mg per kg) in Wistar rats using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The steady-state plasma level of metformin in humans is reported to be around 10 micromolar to 40 micromolar. Previously Chen et al. treated C57B6 mice with metformin at 2 mg/ml in drinking water for 6 days. Measurement of the metformin concentration in these animals using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) showed that it reaches 2 micromolar in plasma and 1 micromolar in forebrain region. For the first time, the present study revealed that in rats untreated with LPS the regions with the highest metformin concentrations were the cerebellum [17.1(2.4) nmol/g] and pituitary gland [21.5(3.4) nmol/g) for acute and chronic administration, respectively. However, the striatum presented the lowest drug level in both dosage schemes of metformin in these rats [2.2(0.6) nmol/g and 1.9(0.3) nmol/g, respectively).

Methyl aminolevulinate	Free radical generation	Photosensitization following application of methyl aminolevulinate cream occurs through the metabolic conversion of methyl aminolevulinate (prodrug) to photoactive porphyrins (PAP), which accumulates in the skin lesions to which the cream has been applied. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated photoactive porphyrins produce a photodynamic reaction, resulting in a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of oxygen. The absorption of light results in an excited state of porphyrin molecules, and subsequent spin transfer from photoactive porphyrins to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.

In the adult rat, the influx rate constant (K(i)) for [(14)C]ALA movement into brain was low ( approximately 0.2 microl/g per min), was unaffected by increasing plasma concentrations of non-radioactive ALA or probenecid (an organic anion transport inhibitor) and, therefore, appears to be a diffusional process. In contrast, at the blood-CSF barrier, there was evidence of carrier-mediated [(14)C]ALA transport from blood to choroid plexus and blood to CSF. In total, these results suggest that the brain is normally fairly well protected from changes in plasma ALA concentration by the very low blood-brain barrier permeability of this compound and by a saturable efflux mechanism present at the choroid plexus.

Methyltestosterone	Androgen receptor agonist	The methyl group aids to increase oral bioavailability. The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5alpha-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.

Our data indicate that nelfinavir has poor penetration into the macaque's brain and CSF, and P-gp inhibition at the BBB by zosuquidar enhanced the distribution of nelfinavir into the brain by 146-fold. However, the concentration of nelfinavir in the CSF was unaffected by coadministration of zosuquidar (p > 0.05). In conclusion, P-gp inhibition at the nonhuman primate BBB significantly enhanced the distribution of nelfinavir into the brain, and this effect was not observed in the CSF.

Clinically, 8 patients with recurrent GBM underwent dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI at baseline followed by tumour resection after 4 days of oral olaparib (tablet: 100 mg QD, n5; 200 mg BID, n3). Olaparib levels were measured in tumour and plasma by LC-MS. Olaparib was a substrate for MDR1 and efflux was blocked by the MDR1 inhibitor ketoconazole. Radioactivity was not detected in the central nervous systems (CNS) of rats or mice after single dose 14C-olaparib, but significant levels were measured in subcutaneous HCT-116 tumour xenografts up to 96 hrs. Olaparib was detected in 24/24 resected GBM specimens from 8 patients at concentrations similar to those in previous breast cancer studies in which PARP inhibition and tumour responses were observed. Pre-treatment DCE-MRI showed increased vascular permeability in tumours, and tumour cellularity parameters correlated with olaparib levels. Conclusions: Olaparib is excluded from the CNS under normal conditions but reliably penetrates recurrent GBM at therapeutic levels. Small molecule PK in GBM are poorly predicted by standard pre-clinical models.

The mean area under concentration-time curve (AUC)(brain)/AUC(plasma) ratio of unbound pemetrexed was 0.078 +/- 0.038 in the i.v. bolus study. The pemetrexed steady-state brain-to-plasma unbound concentration ratio after i.v. infusion was 0.106 +/- 0.054. The distributional clearance into the brain was approximately 10% of the clearance out of the brain in both the compartmental and noncompartmental analyses. Indomethacin had no effect on either the brain-to-plasma AUC ratio or the steady-state brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The distribution of pemetrexed into the brain is limited, and an efflux clearance process, such as an efflux transporter, may be involved.

Pentostatin	Adenosine deaminase inhibitor	Pentostatin is a potent transition state inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the greatest activity of which is found in cells of the lymphoid system. T-cells have higher ADA activity than B-cells, and T-cell malignancies have higher activity than B-cell malignancies. The cytotoxicity that results from prevention of catabolism of adenosine or deoxyadenosine is thought to be due to elevated intracellular levels of dATP, which can block DNA synthesis through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. An additional cytotoxic effect is related to its incorporation into RNA. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase).

Pomalidomide	Cereblon (ubiquitination), immunomodulating	Cereblon was identified as the direct molecular target modulating the anti-proliferative and some immunomodulatory effects of pomalidomide. Cereblon affects polyubiquitination of proteins, targeting them for destruction in the proteosome and its expression was required in T cells for pomalidomide-induction of IL- 2 and TNF-alpha. Pomalidomide and lenalidomide exhibited similar binding affinity for cereblon and the expression of this protein in myeloma cell lines was shown to be required for pomalidomide to exert its effects. Decreased levels of cereblon correlated with acquisition of resistance to lenalidomide in different cell lines. Pomalidomide was also shown to affect the cell cycle producing G1 arrest in different cell lines and to induce apoptosis by down regulating CDK4 and CDK6 responses with no effect on CDK2. CDK regulation was associated with decreases in retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and decreased levels of other proteins that are important regulators of cell growth and differentiation in myeloma cell lines. The immunomodulatory effects of pomalidomide included the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lipopolysaccharide stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells including IL-12, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, GM CSF production, MCP-1, and MIP-1alpha, and increased production of IL-10.

Pralatrexate	Antifolate	The selectivity of pralatrexate for cancer cells is based upon the observation that cancer cells generally have an overexpression of reduced folate carrier protein-1 (RTC-1) compared to normal somatic cells. This carrier protein allows the entrance of pralatrexate into the cell. Upon entering the cell, folypolyglutamate synthase FPGS catalyzes the polyglutamination of pralatrexate so that it is retained inside the cell. Once inside, pralatrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase. Subsequent depletion of thymidine monophosphate (TMP) occurs so that the cancer cell is unable to synthesize DNA and RNA. As a result, the cancer cell cannot proliferate and is forced to undergo apoptosis. Pralatrexate is more effective against cells that are actively dividing.

The brain/plasma concentration ratio ranged from 5.7 to 12.7. (2) The concentration of the four beta-blockers in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue are shown in Table 2. It is apparent that CSF concentration is a poor predictor of brain concentration, e.g. propranolol was hardly detectable in CSF in contrast to its very high concentration in the brain. The brain concentration of the three lipophilic agents was some 10-20 times higher than the concentration of atenolol, and the approximate brain/plasma ratios were 26 for propranolol, 50 for oxprenolol, 12 for metoprolol and 0.2 for atenolol. Propranolol was administered at 160 mg/day for 9-11 days, achievinga brain concentration of 830-5669 ng per g, and a mean brain to plasma ratio of 26.  (3) Our case of MIH with multiple cerebral and spinal lesions was also successfully treated with propranolol, with rapid improvement by day 45 and disappearance of lesions on neuroimaging at 6 months.Treatment with propranolol 1 mg/kg daily was started on day 8 of life.

Simvastatin	HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor	Simvastatin is a prodrug in which the 6-membered lactone ring of simvastatin is hydrolyzed in vivo to generate the beta,delta-dihydroxy acid, an active metabolite structurally similar to HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA). Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme.

Mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last statin administration, cerebral cortex dissected and statin levels were determined by LC-MS/MS. Relatively low levels of simvastatin and lovastatin lactones were detected but pravastatin was not detected in the cerebral cortex 24 h after the last drug administration. The low levels of simvastatin and lovastatin and the absence of pravastatin at 24 h were puzzling because of the significant effects of all 3 statins on brain gene expression. To begin to examine the possibility that statins did not accumulate in brain, we examined statins levels in mice given a single administration and then sacrificed at 1, 3, and 6 h following drug administration. Simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin were all detected in the cerebral cortex. Not surprisingly, brain levels of the three statins reflected their lipophilicity with simvastatin levels >lovastatin levels> pravastatin levels. Statins are substrates for P-gp and this transporter may play a role in statin efflux from cells.

YES	2.701904762	NO	unspecified	ABCC2	ABCB1	We examined the disposition of atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin in acid and lactone forms and pravastatin in acid form in multidrug-resistant gene (mdr1a/b) knockout (KO), and wild-type (WT) mice. A significantly higher (p < 0.05) brain penetration in the KO compared with the WT mice was observed for lovastatin acid (but the brain/plasma ratio was low for both KO and WT mice) and lactone and simvastatin lactone but not for atorvastatin or pravastatin. The present results suggest that mouse P-glycoprotein does not affect the lactone-acid interconversion or liver-plasma distribution. Furthermore, P-glycoprotein plays a limited role in restricting the brain penetration of the acid forms of atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin lactone but may limit the brain availability of the lactone forms of simvastatin and lovastatin.	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17640956	Chen C, Drug Metab Dispos 2007, 35:1725-1729	yes	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Diabetes mellitus, Hepatotoxicity, Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, Myopathy/rhabdomyolysis	Amiodarone, AmLODIPine, Antacids, Aripiprazole, Azithromycin (Systemic), Bezafibrate, Boceprevir, Bosentan, Clarithromycin, Colchicine, Cyclosporine (Systemic), CYP3A4 Inducers (Strong), CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Moderate), CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong), Cyproterone, Dabrafenib, Danazol, Daptomycin, Dasatinib, Deferasirox, Diltiazem, Dronedarone, Efavirenz, Eltrombopag, Erlotinib, Erythromycin (Systemic), Etravirine, Fenofibrate, Fenofibric Acid, Fluconazole, Fosphenytoin, Fusidic Acid, Gemfibrozil, Grapefruit Juice, Green Tea, Imatinib, Ivacaftor, Lanthanum, Lomitapide, Mifepristone, Niacin, Niacinamide, Pazopanib, Phenytoin, Protease Inhibitors, Proton Pump Inhibitors, Quinine, Ranolazine, Red Yeast Rice, Rifamycin Derivatives, RisperiDONE, Sildenafil, Sitagliptin, St Johns Wort, Telaprevir, Telithromycin, Ticagrelor, Tocilizumab, Trabectedin, Verapamil, Vitamin K Antagonists	CYP3A4	CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6	unspecified	FDA Approved	4.42	4.42	73	419	1	13.49	0.29	0	1	0.578571429	0.833333333	0	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	SLCO1B1	SLCO1A2; SLCO1B1	Oral	Zocor
Sirolimus	mTOR	Sirolimus inhibits T lymphocyte activation and proliferation that occurs in response to antigenic and cytokine (Interleukin IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15) stimulation by a mechanism that is distinct from that of other immunosuppressants. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex. The sirolimus:FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. This complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. This inhibition suppresses cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, inhibiting the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle.

Thioguanine	Purine antagonist	purine antagonist.1 It is a pro-drug that is converted intracellullarly directly to thioguanine monophosphate3 (also called 6-thioguanylic acid)4 (TGMP) by the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). TGMP is further converted to the di- and triphosphates, thioguanosine diphosphate (TGDP) and thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP).5 The cytotoxic effect of thioguanine is a result of the incorporation of these nucleotides into DNA. Thioguanine has some immunosuppressive activity.1	NO	We evaluated the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) or lomustine (CCNU) in combination with 6-thioguanine, capecitabine, and celecoxib for the treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma.

Topotecan	Topoisomerase I inhibitor	semisynthetic, water-soluble derivative of camptothecin, which is a cytotoxic alkaloid extracted from plants such as Camptotheca acuminata. Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan. It inhibits the action of topoisomerase I, an enzyme that produces reversible single-strand breaks in DNA during DNA replication. These single-strand breaks relieve torsional strain and allow DNA replication to proceed. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of the DNA strand, resulting in double strand DNA breakage and cell death.3 Unlike irinotecan, topotecan is found predominantly in the inactive carboxylate form at neutral pH and it is not a prodrug.

Vinorelbine	Vinca alkaloid	semisynthetic vinca alkaloid derived from vinblastine. Vinca alkaloids such as vincristine and vinblastine are originally derived from periwinkle leaves (vinca rosea).2 Vinorelbine inhibits cell growth by binding to the tubulin of the mitotic microtubules.3 Like other mitotic inhibitors, vinorelbine also promotes apoptosis in cancer cells.2 In vitro vinorelbine shows both multidrug and non-multidrug resistance.3 Microtubules are present in mitotic spindles, neuronal axons, and other cells. Inhibition of mitotic microtubules appears to correlate with antitumour activity, while inhibition of axonal microtubules seems to correlate with neurotoxicity.

Vorinostat	HDAC inhibitor	Vorinostat inhibits the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II) at nanomolar concentrations (IC50< 86 nM). These enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones proteins. In some cancer cells, there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic transcription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. By inhibiting histone deacetylase, vorinostat causes the accumulation of acetylated histones and induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells.

Zoledronic acid	Bisphosphonate	The action of zoledronate on bone tissue is based partly on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Zoledronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as zoledronate appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.
