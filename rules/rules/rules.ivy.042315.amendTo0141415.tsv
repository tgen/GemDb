Cisplatin	unspecified	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	gene	ATRX	546	EMPTY	exp	under	yes	inferred	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23284920	In this study, we developed primary cell cultures from Atrxf/f mice and infected them with Adenovirus expressing either Cre or LacZ to investigate how ATRX regulates cell survival in an otherwise genetically identical background. We demonstrate that multiple primary cell types (myoblasts, embryonic fibroblasts and neurospheres) were sensitive to 5-FU, cisplatin, and UV light treatment. Together, our results suggest that cells lacking Atrx are more sensitive to DNA damaging agents and that this may result in enhanced death during development when cells are at their proliferative peak. We observed a general sensitivity to DNA damaging agents that could be rescued by removing p53, suggesting that Atrx plays a role in maintaining DNA integrity and preventing activation of p53-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, it identifies potential treatment options for cancers associated with ATRX mutations, including glioblastoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.	unspecified	Conte D, Plos One 2012, 7:e52167	unspecified
