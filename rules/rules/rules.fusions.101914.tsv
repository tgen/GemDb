Pazopanib	Votrient	fused_gene	FGFR2_[CCDS]	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	yes	inferred	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550739	Genome-wide structural analysis of sequence data revealed recurrent translocation events involving the FGFR2 locus in three of six assessed cholangiocarcinoma patients. These observations and supporting evidence triggered the use of FGFR inhibitors in these patients. In one example, preliminary anti-tumor activity of pazopanib (in vitro FGFR2 IC50 350 nM) was noted in a patient with an FGFR2-TACC3 fusion. After progression on pazopanib, the same patient also had stable disease on ponatinib, a pan-FGFR inhibitor (in vitro, FGFR2 IC50 8 nM).	This rule is an inferred wild card fusion rule.

Contemporaneously with the entrance of patient into the clinical trial, NGS was performed. Genomic profiling identified the following alterations: a KIAA1549-BRAF gene fusion resulting from a tandem duplication event, a homozygous deletion of PTEN, and frameshift insertion/deletions in CDKN2A A68fs*51, SUFU E283fs*3, and MAP3K1 N325fs*3. The patient had a 25% reduction in tumor (RECIST v1.1) following combination therapy consisting of sorafenib, temsirolimus, and bevazicumab within a phase I clinical trial. The patient responded to combination targeted therapy that fortuitously targeted KIAA1549-BRAF and PTEN loss within a spindle cell neoplasm, as revealed by genomic profiling based on NGS. This is the first report of a tumor driven by a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion responding to sorafenib-based combination therapy.	This rule is an inferred wild card fusion rule.

The most prevalent fusion, SND1-BRAF, results in activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway which can be abrogated with MEK inhibition. SND1-BRAF transformed cells were sensitive to treatment with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib.	This rule is an inferred wild card fusion rule.

It is highly likely that all fusion kinases with BRAF truncations of the N terminus function as constitutive dimers and are resistant to current first-generation BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib.	This rule is an inferred wild card fusion rule.	Sievert A, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2013, 110:5957-5962	pediatric astrocytoma
