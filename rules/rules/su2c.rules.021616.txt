Similar results for FGFR fusion-positive lines were obtained in vivo. SW780 xenografts exhibited decreased tumor growth with increasing doses of PD173074, whereas J82 xenografts did not (Fig. 4B). Expression of the FGFR3-BAIAP2L1 fusion in vitro induced ERK1/2 activation (Supplementary Fig. S5), and, similarly, fusion-positive SW780 xenografts exhibited strong ERK1/2 activation, which could be abolished by treatment with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 (Fig. 4C). |Evidence Level:  Pre-clinical.

As shown (Figure 2D), this inhibitor had a magnified effect on decreasing cell proliferation in the tumor cells ectopically expressing the FGFR2 fusion. To gain more direct evidence of the effect of the FGFR2-FAM76A fusion on tumor cell growth and its possible therapeutic candidacy, we next analyzed the effect of the inhibitor on patient-derived tumor cell lines. Specifically, the effect of FGFR inhibition was compared between patient-derived ascites cell lines from this patient and two other patients (ISM1 and ISM2) who had also presented with stage IIIC primary ovarian cancer (Figure 3). The FGFR2-FAM76A fusion was present, in both DNA and RNA, exclusively in the tumor cells from our original patient but not in the other two patient-derived cell lines ISM1 and ISM2. Treatment with BGJ398, depending on dose, significantly reduced cell viability by more than 40% in the FGFR fusion-expressing cell line. In the other two cell lines, treatment with the FGFR inhibitor had no significant effect on cell viability. |Evidence Level:  Pre-clinical.

These observations support the notion that the activation of SRC and FAK due to LKB1 loss promotes dependence upon these signaling pathways for cell migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix components as well as migration. |Annotator Note: SNVs should be loss-of-function and associated with drug sensitivity.

Grade 3 proteinuria was a late toxicity requiring further dose reduction to 20 mg/day. Despite the need for dose reductions, the patient had clinical improvement in cough and shortness of breath and a partial response to therapy at 4 weeks (Fig. 2B).

Resistant cells displayed MET gene amplification, leading to increased expression and constitutive phosphorylation of MET, followed by subsequent amplification and overexpression of wild-type (wt) KRAS. Cells harboring KRAS amplification progressively lost their MET dependence and acquired KRAS dependence. FISH analysis showed that the extra copies of KRAS were progressively acquired as double minutes outside chromosome 12 (where KRAS is positioned; Fig. 3D). Our results suggest that MET and KRAS amplification is a general mechanism of resistance to specific MET inhibitors given that similar results were observed with two small inhibitors and in different cell lines of different histotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that overexpression of wt KRAS can overcome the inhibitory effect of a RTK inhibitor. "	EMPTY	unspecified	unspecified	767

L858R mutations occur- ring in combination with either A871E, L747S, de novo G719S, de novo T790M, L861P, or R776G were associated with disease progression."	EMPTY	unspecified	unspecified	1451

Our analyses of two independent sets of paired EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma samples from patients treated with EGFR inhibitors confirm that downregulation of NF1 expres- sion at the time of TKI resistance is a common occurrence in the clinic. Furthermore, NF1 levels may influence the initial response to TKIs, as low neurofibromin in pretreatment specimens is strongly associated with reduced overall sur- vival for patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas treated with EGFR TKI. |Annotator Note:SNVs should be loss-of-function and associated with reduced drug sensitivity.

In GR cells, gefitinib reduced phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB-3, and Erk but not Akt. These cells also showed hyperphosphorylation of the IGFI receptor (IGFIR) and constitutive association of IRS-1 with PI3K. Inhibition of IGFIR signaling disrupted the association of IRS-1 with PI3K and restored the ability of gefitinib to downregulate PI3K/Akt signaling and to inhibit GR cell growth. |Annotator Note: SNVs should be activating and associated with reduced drug sensitivity.

MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF-_R2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF-_R signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF-_ signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers. |Annotator Note:SNVs should be loss-of-function and associated with reduced drug sensitivity.

Inhibition of ERBB3 only had minor effects on proliferation of H358 cells, but suppression of ERBB3 in combination with selumetinib caused a marked inhibition of proliferation in H358 cells (Figures 1C and 1D).

MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF-_R signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF-_ signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers. |Annotator Note:SNVs should be loss-of-function and associated with reduced drug sensitivity.

Notably, carfilzomib also showed striking in vivo activity in a BRAF-mutant human colorectal cancer xenograft model. Vulnerability to proteasome inhibitors is dependent on persistent BRAF signaling, because BRAF V600E blockade by PLX4720 reversed sensitivity to carfilzomib in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cells.

The fact that the RB1-ITM2B gene fusion maps to a region commonly deleted in melanoma, raises the possibility that inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor may contribute to melanoma pathology independent of CDKN2A/ARF deletion.

The tumor harbored EGFR exon 19 deletion and BRAF G469A (Table 2 and Fig. S5). The BRAF G469A mutation was confirmed to be absent before treatment. 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor.  Transfectants with mutant BRAF were sensitive to the combination of EGFR and BRAF inhibition as well. |Evidence Level:  Case Study. Preclinical.

PC-9/ER3 cells were 136-fold more resistant to erlotinib than the parental cells. Although the PC-9/ER3 cells did not carry the T790M mutation or MET amplification and had similar levels of phosphorylated (p) STAT3, pJAK2 increased in the resistant cells. It was found in the present study that 3-12 h of exposure to erlotinib in both cell lines did not affect pJAK2 expression, but did result in increased pSTAT3 expression. pAkt in PC-9/ER3 cells was less suppressed than in PC-9 cells, although pEGFR and pMAPK were markedly suppressed in both cell lines. The combined treatment of erlotinib plus a JAK2 inhibitor (JSI-124) suppressed pAkt in PC-9/ER3 cells. Similarly, the combination of erlotinib plus JSI-124 or siRNA against JAK2 restored sensitivity to erlotinib in PC-9/ER3 cells. |Annotator Note: SNVs should be activating and associated with reduced drug sensitivity.

MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF-_R2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF-_R signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF-_ signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers. |Annotator Note:SNVs should be loss-of-function and associated with reduced drug sensitivity.

MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF-_R signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF-_ signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers. |Annotator Note:SNVs should be loss-of-function and associated with reduced drug sensitivity.

The tumor vascular pattern prompted us to use sunitinib malate (SM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic properties. We have been treating five patients with progressive, heavily pretreated, advanced ASPS, resistant to IFN, with continuous SM. Among the four patients evaluable for response, two showed a RECIST partial response, as well as a PET response. One had a RECIST stable disease, whereas the other progressed.

Complementation clearly protected cells from cell death induced by TMZ (Fig. 4A), indicating that the hypersensitivity of the cells was due to mutational inactivation of the NBN gene. Down-regulation of NBN in melanoma cells by small interfering RNA rendered them more sensitive to temozolomide, suggesting that NBN is a novel modulator of temozolomide sensitivity. |Annotator Note: SNVs should be loss-of-function and associated with drug sensitivity.
