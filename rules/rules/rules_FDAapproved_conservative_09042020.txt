We assessed the association between ERG rearrangement status and clinical benefit from abiraterone acetate. COU-AA-302 is a phase III trial comparing abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus prednisone in chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. ERG status was defined for 348 of 1,088 intention-to-treat patients. ERG was rearranged in 121 of 348 patients with confirmed ERG status (35 percent). Cancers with an ERG fusion secondary to deletion of 21q22 and increased copy number of fusion sequences (class 2-plus Edel) had a greater improvement in rPFS after abiraterone acetate and prednisone [22 vs. 5.4 months;  P equals 0.0033] than cancers with no ERG fusion [16.7 vs. 8.3 months; P equals 0.0002] or other classes of ERG rearrangement. Both ERG-rearranged and wild-type cancers had a significant improvement in rPFS with abiraterone acetate and prednisone in the COU-AA-302 trial. However, our data suggest that 2-plus Edel cancers, accounting for 15 percent of all mCRPC patients and previously associated with a worse outcome, derived the greatest benefit.

The presence of extra copies of the DNMT3B gene is linked to higher levels of the corresponding mRNA and protein. Most importantly, the elevated gene dosage of DNMT3B is associated with increased resistance to the growth-inhibitory effect mediated by DNA demethylating agents. In particular, cancer cells harboring DNMT3B gene amplification are less sensitive to the decrease in cell viability caused by 5-azacytidine (Vidaza), 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (Decitabine), and SGI-1027. Overall, the data confirm DNMT3B as a bona fide oncogene in human cancer and support the incorporation of the DNMT3B copy number assay into current clinical trials assessing the efficacy of DNA demethylating drugs in solid tumors."	unspecified	"Simo-Riudalbas L, Genes Chromosomes Cancer 2011, 50:527-534"	"breast cancer, pancreatic cancer"

The response rate (including hematological improvement) was 82 percent in MUT versus 45 percent in WT patients (P=0.007). Response duration and overall survival were, however, comparable in the MUT and WT groups. In a multivariate analysis (logistic regression) that included cytogenetic risk, previous therapy and TET2 status, mutated TET2 (P=0.04) and adverse cytogenetics (intermediate: P=0.048, poor: P=0.040), but not previous therapy (P=0.47) independently predicted a higher ORR (Table 4). In higher risk MDS and AML with low blast count, TET2 status may be a genetic predictor of response to AZA, independently of karyotype."	unspecified	"Itzykson R, Leukemia 2011, 25: 1147-1152"	"myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia"

Metastatic tumor lesions were found in the scapula, vertebral body, iliac crest, and liver. He progressed after receiving first line systemic treatment with carboplatinpaclitaxel. RET translocation was demonstrated by FISH and corroborated by a CCDC6-RET fusion on NGS. Cabozantinib therapy was initiated at 140 mg per day.

KRAS amplification was detected in 7/1,039 (0.67 percent) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors. We profiled a large dataset of CRC cell lines and found that only one of 102 lines (1 percent) harbored KRAS amplification (Fig. 2a) with corresponding protein overexpression (Fig. 2b). We established that the KRAS amplified NCI-H630 cell line was intrinsically resistant to cetuximab similarly to KRAS mutant CRC models (Fig. 2c).  Down-regulation of KRAS expression was able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in NCI-H630 cells, thus unequivocally establishing the role of KRAS amplification in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in this model (Fig. 2e). LIkewise, transduction of the EGFR expressing and cetuximab sensitive LIM1215 cell line (Fig. 2c) with serial diultions of KRAS wildtype lentivirus (Fig 2f) revealed that cells expressing lower KRAS levels (dilutions 1:8 and 1:10) were still sensitive to EGFR inhibition, while cells displaying more abundant KRAS (virus titers 1:2 and 1:4) were significantly more resistant to cetuximab than control cells (Fig. 2g). Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in CRC, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients.

A rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene was detected using FISH both in the well-differentiated and anaplastic components of the thyroid tumor and in the anaplastic lung metastases. The patient was treated with crizotinib and presented an excellent response of >90 percent across all pulmonary lesions (criteria RECIST 1.1) that was confirmed at 6 months after therapy initiation. We report here the subsequent identification of STRN gene as the ALK fusion partner.  The STRN/ALK transcript consisted of the fusion between exon 3 of STRN and exon 20 of ALK. Subsequent screening of 75 various thyroid tumors by RT-PCR revealed that 2 out of 29 papillary thyroid carcinomas exhibited the same fusion transcript. 	unspecified	"Perot G, Plos One 2014, 9:e87170"	thyroid carcinoma

RNA-seq data demonstrated that this mutation, MEK2Q60P, was expressed in the resistant tumor but not in the pretreatment tumor (Fig. 1A, right). MEK2 mutations have not previously been identified in patients with acquired resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, although similar mutations were found to confer resistance to single-agent RAF inhibitors in a companion study. MEK2Q60P is homologous to MEK1Q56P, which confers resistance to monotherapy with RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in post-progression tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.  MEK2Q60P conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK).

Compared with the effects of wild-type MEK2, cells expressing resistance-associated MEK2 mutations were less sensitive to both RAF (dabrafenib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibition. MEK2 C125S conferred profound resistance to both RAF and MEK inhibition, with fold changes in GI50 greater than 100. The MEK2 V35M, L46F, and N126D mutants also engendered resistance to RAF and MEK inhibition, although their effect was not as pronounced as those of MEK2 C125S. All MEK2-mutant alleles examined conferred sustained MEK and ERK phosphorylation in the context of RAF inhbitor treatment (Fig 2F).

As expected, wild-type ESR1 was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen, fulvestrant and endoxifen (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 46).  Interestingly, ESR1 with each of the five LBD alterations identified in this study was inhibited by tamoxifen and fulvestrant in a dose-dependent fashion. The IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values for both 4-hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant were two- to fourfold higher for all mutants compared to wild-type ESR1. Fulvestrant exhibited greater maximal inhibition than 4-hydroxytamoxifen for all the mutants tested (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5).  It has been suggested that more potent ER antagonists, such as the next generation of estrogen receptor degraders, may have therapeutic benefit."	unspecified	"Robinson D, Nat Genet 2013, 45:1446-1451"	breast cancer

Baseline tissue biopsies were available from patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who were enrolled onto the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization trial (NeoALTTO). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 23 percent of HER2-positive breast tumors, and these mutations were associated with poorer outcome in all of the treatment arms. Patients treated with a combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib who had wild-type PIK3CA obtained a total pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of 53.1 percent, which decreased to 28.6 percent in patients with tumors that carried PIK3CA activating mutations (P equals .012). Activating mutations in PIK3CA predicted poor pCR in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapies that target HER2. For each treatment arm, the pCR rate was lower for patients with PIK3CA mutations than for wild-type patients, although this difference was largest in the combination (lapatinib plus trastuzumab) treatment arm."	unspecified	"Majewski I, J Clin Oncol 2015, 33:1334-1339"	breast cancer

This study aimed to analyse the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of lorlatinib, a novel, highly potent, selective, and brain-penetrant ALK and ROS1 TKI with preclinical activity against most known resistance mutations, in patients with advanced ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC. In this phase 1, dose-escalation study, lorlatinib showed both systemic and intracranial activity in patients with advanced ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC, most of whom had CNS metastases and had previously had two or more TKI treatments fail. Therefore, lorlatinib might be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who have become resistant to currently available TKIs, including second-generation ALK TKIs."	unspecified	"Shaw A, Lancet Oncol 2017, 18:15901599"	NSCLC

Nilotinib was approved on the basis of the initial results of this phase 2 open-label study.  Overall, 59 percent of patients achieved major CyR; this was complete CyR (CCyR) in 44 percent. Of patients achieving CCyR, 56 percent achieved major molecular response. CyRs were durable, with 84 percent of patients who achieved CCyR maintaining response at 24 months. The overall survival at 24 months was 87 percent. This study indicates that nilotinib is effective, with a manageable safety profile, and can provide favorable long-term benefits for patients with CML-CP after imatinib failure. Drug label states Nilotinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph-positive CML) in chronic phase and is indicated for the treatment of chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph-positive CML) in adult patients resistant or intolerant to prior therapy that included imatinib.

In a phase I trial of PD0332991, several patients with WDLS or DDLS experienced prolonged stable disease. We performed an open-label phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of PD0332991 in patients with advanced WDLS/DDLS. We screened 48 patients (44 of 48 had CDK4 amplification; 41 of 44 were RB positive). Of those, 30 were enrolled, and 29 were evaluable for the primary end point. At 12 weeks, PFS was 66 percent, significantly exceeding the primary end point. The median PFS was 18 weeks. There was one partial response.

Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. Ponatinib potently inhibited native (wild-type) KIT, as well as KIT with mutations within exon 11 (V559D and V560G), at the gatekeeper residue (T670I) and within the A-loop (D816H, D820E, and A829P), although it was less potent against V654A. Ponatinib had at least an order of magnitude greater potency against A-loop mutants than imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. In a patient-derived xenograft harboring a Y823D A-loop secondary mutation and an exon 11 primary mutation (del557558), a single dose of ponatinib inhibited KIT-driven signaling, and once daily dosing rapidly induced complete regression. Three refractory patients with GIST, all of whom had been treated previously with, at a minimum, imatinib (both 400 and 800 mg), sunitinib, and regorafenib, were treated with ponatinib. Patients were treated with 30 mg ponatinib, administered orally once daily, and evaluated by CT scan after 4 weeks of treatment. All patients were known to have had primary KIT mutations in exon 11. Notably, ponatinib displayed clinical activity in 2 of the 3 patients. "	unspecified	"Garner A, Clin Cancer Res 2014, 20:5745-5755"	GIST

In three of these patients, we identified additional mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations in the resistant tumor that were not detected in the pretreatment tumor, including a novel activating mutation in MEK2 (MEK2Q60P). RNA-seq data demonstrated that this mutation, MEK2Q60P, was expressed in the resistant tumor but not in the pretreatment tumor (Fig. 1A, right). MEK2 mutations have not previously been identified in patients with acquired resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, although similar mutations were found to confer resistance to single-agent RAF inhibitors in a companion study. MEK2Q60P is homologous to MEK1Q56P, which confers resistance to monotherapy with RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in post-progression tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.  MEK2Q60P conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK). Compared with parental controls and cells expressing wild-type MEK2, the MEK2Q60P mutation conferred profound resistance to the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib (Fig. 2A), as well as to single-agent dabrafenib (Fig. 2B) and trametinib (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, MEK2Q60P did not confer resistance to treatment with an extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (Fig. 2D), which targets the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK1/2. Cells expressing MEK2Q60P exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 at baseline and when treated with dabrafenib/trametinib than wild-type A375 cells or those expressing wild-type MEK2 (Fig. 2E), indicative of enhanced MAPK pathway activation despite combined therapeutic blockade of this pathway.

Y806 maps close to the gate-keeper position at the RET kinase nucleotide-binding pocket. Although tyrosine 806 is a RET auto-phosphorylation site, its substitution to phenylalanine (Y806F) did not markedly affect RET susceptibility to ZD6474 (IC(50): 87 nM), suggesting that phosphorylation of Y806 is not required for compound binding. Accordingly, the introduction of a phosphomimetic residue (Y806E) also caused resistance to ZD6474, albeit of a lesser degree (IC(50): 512 nM) than the cysteine mutation. Y806C/E RET mutants were also resistant to ZD6474 with respect to intracellular signalling and activation of an AP1-responsive promoter.

The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. The G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively."	unspecified	"Pricl S, Mol Oncol 2015, 9:389-397"	basal cell carcinoma

Molecular analyses of tumor specimens obtained before treatment suggested that there was activation of the hedgehog pathway, with loss of heterozygosity and somatic mutation of the gene encoding patched homologue 1 (PTCH1), a key negative regulator of hedgehog signaling. Genomic analysis of the PTCH1 locus in tumor cells was consistent with loss of heterozygosity and a single nucleotide substitution in exon 15 causing a W to C amino acid change at position 844."	unspecified	"Rudin C, N Engl J Med 2009, 361:1173-1178"	medulloblastoma

BICR-78, an esophageal SCC line, harbored a homozygous missense mutation resulting in an arginine to cysteine change at position 505 (Fig. 3A). Arginine 505 is among the three most common FBW7 codons targeted for mutation in human cancers, and tumor-associated mutations at this position have been demonstrated to disrupt substrate binding."	unspecified	"He L, Cancer Discov 2013, 3:324-337"	squamous cell carcinoma
