Afatinib	Gilotrif	gene	EGFR	1956	TGENTV0002	exp	over	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	EMPTY	yes	inferred	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22001862	By systematic analysis of GBM genomic data, we have identified and characterized a novel exon 27 deletion mutation occurring within the EGFR carboxyl-terminus domain (CTD), in addition to identifying additional examples of previously reported deletion mutations in this region. We show that the GBM-derived EGFR CTD deletion mutants are able to induce cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo in the absence of ligand and receptor autophosphorylation. Erlotinib and cetuximab inhibited the growth of tumors driven by C-terminal deletion EGFR mutants, indicating that both small molecule inhibitors and anti-EGFR mAbs may be promising therapeutic approaches in treating GBM patients with tumors harboring such deletions. Cetuximab in particular prolonged the survival of intracranially xenografted mice with oncogenic EGFR CTD deletion mutants, compared with untreated control mice.
